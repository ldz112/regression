{"text":"\nyou are a mathematics expert,skilled in solving methematical problems and logical reasoning.\nPlease read the question carefully and provide detailed solution steps.\n\n<|Question|>\nMarty plans to paint a fence and can choose from five different colors: blue, green, yellow, black, or white. He can also choose from four different painting tools: a brush, a roller, a sponge, or a spray gun. How many different combinations of color and painting tool can Marty choose?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so Marty wants to paint a fence, and he has some choices to make. He can pick from five different colors: blue, green, yellow, black, or white. That's five options right there. Then, he also has four different painting tools to choose from: a brush, a roller, a sponge, or a spray gun. So, four tools to pick from.\n\nNow, the question is asking how many different combinations of color and painting tool Marty can choose. Hmm, combinations... That means we're looking for all the possible ways he can pair a color with a tool. So, for each color, he can use any of the four tools, right?\n\nLet me think about this step by step. If Marty picks blue as his color, he can use a brush, roller, sponge, or spray gun. That's four combinations just for blue. The same goes for green: brush, roller, sponge, spray gun. So that's another four combinations. And this pattern continues for each color.\n\nSo, if there are five colors and for each color there are four tools, then the total number of combinations should be 5 multiplied by 4. Let me write that down: 5 colors \u00d7 4 tools = 20 combinations.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check. If Marty has five colors and four tools, then for each color, he has four choices of tools. So, for each color, that's four combinations. Since there are five colors, it's like adding four combinations five times, which is the same as multiplying 5 by 4. Yep, that gives 20.\n\nIs there another way to think about this? Maybe using the counting principle. The counting principle says that if there are m ways to do one thing and n ways to do another, then there are m \u00d7 n ways to do both. In this case, choosing a color is one thing with m=5, and choosing a tool is another thing with n=4. So, according to the counting principle, the total number of combinations is 5 \u00d7 4 = 20.\n\nI think that's correct. So, Marty has 20 different combinations he can choose from when painting his fence.\n<\/think>\n\nMarty has 20 different combinations of color and painting tool to choose from when painting his fence. This is calculated by multiplying the number of color choices (5) by the number of painting tool choices (4), resulting in 5 \u00d7 4 = 20 combinations.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo find the total number of combinations that Marty can choose from, we need to multiply the number of color choices by the number of painting tool options.\n- Number of color choices: 5 (blue, green, yellow, black, white)\n- Number of painting tool choices: 4 (brush, roller, sponge, spray gun)\n\nThe total number of combinations is calculated by:\n\\[ 5 \\text{ colors} \\times 4 \\text{ tools} = 20 \\text{ combinations} \\]\nThus, there are a total of $\\boxed{20}$ different combinations Marty can choose.\n"}

This means I can represent the income as 7 times a common variable and the expenditure as 6 times the same variable.\n\nNext, I know that savings are calculated by subtracting expenditure from income. The problem states that the savings amount to Rs. 3000. By setting up the equation 7x - 6x = 3000, I can solve for the common variable x.\n\nSimplifying the equation, I find that x equals 3000.

This means that 50 - 35 = 15 houses have only a two-car garage.\n\nSince there are 55 houses with at least one feature and 15 of them have only a garage, the remaining 55 - 15 = 40 houses must have only an in-the-ground swimming pool.\n\nTherefore, the total number of houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool is 40.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the number of houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool, let's break down the information step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Total number of houses (T):** 65\n- **Number of houses with a two-car garage (G):** 50\n- **Number of houses with both a two-car garage and an in-the-ground swimming pool (G \u2229 S):** 35\n- **Number of houses with neither feature (N):** 10\n\n**Objective:**\nFind the number of houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool (**S**).\n\n**Step 1: Calculate the number of houses with at least one feature.**\n\nThe total number of houses with at least one feature (either a two-car garage or an in-the-ground swimming pool or both) can be found by subtracting the number of houses with neither feature from the total number of houses:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Houses with at least one feature} = T - N = 65 - 10 = 55\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion.**\n\nThe Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion helps in finding the number of elements in the union of two sets. In this context, it can be used to find the number of houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Houses with at least one feature} = G + S - (G \\cap S)\n\\]\n\nPlugging in the known values:\n\n\\[\n55 = 50 + S - 35\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Solve for \\( S \\).**\n\n\\[\n55 = 50 + S - 35 \\\\\n55 = 15 + S \\\\\nS = 55 - 15 \\\\\nS = 40\n\\]\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere are \\(\\boxed{40}\\) houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the number of houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool as S.\n\nFrom the information given, we can set up the following relationships:\n\n1. The total number of houses with a two-car garage (G) is 50.\n2. The number of houses with both a two-car garage and an in-the-ground swimming pool (G \u2229 S) is 35.\n3. The number of houses with neither feature (neither G nor S) is 10.\n\nWe also know that the total number of houses (T) is 65.\n\nWe can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion to find the number of houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool (S). The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is the size of the first set plus the size of the second set minus the size of their intersection:\n\nT = G + S - (G \u2229 S) + (neither G nor S)\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n65 = 50 + S - 35 + 10\n\nNow, we solve for S:\n\n65 = 50 + S - 35 + 10\n65 = 25 + S\nS = 65 - 25\nS = 40\n\nSo, there are $\\boxed{40}$  houses with an in-the-ground swimming pool.\n"}

Since the train crosses the bridge in 30 seconds, we can convert the train's speed from km\/hr to m\/s to match the units of the bridge's length and the time taken.\n\nThe conversion factor from km\/hr to m\/s is:\n1 km\/hr = 1000 m \/ 3600 s\n\nSo, the train's speed in m\/s is:\n45 km\/hr * (1000 m \/ 3600 s) = 12.5 m\/s\n\nNow, we can calculate the distance the train travels in 30 seconds at this speed:\nDistance = Speed * Time\nDistance = 12.5 m\/s * 30 s = 375 meters\n\nThis distance is the combined length of the train and the bridge. Since we know the length of the bridge is 240 meters, we can find the length of the train by subtracting the bridge's length from the total distance:\n\nLength of the train = Total distance - Length of the bridge\nLength of the train = 375 meters - 240 meters = 135 meters\n\nTherefore, the length of the train is $\\boxed{135}$  meters.\n"}

If one of the endpoints is $(0, 11)$, what is the other endpoint? Express your answer as an ordered pair.\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here where I need to find the other endpoint of a line segment when I know the midpoint and one endpoint. Let me see... The midpoint is given as (3, 7), and one of the endpoints is (0, 11). Hmm, I remember that the midpoint formula involves averaging the coordinates of the two endpoints. Let me try to recall exactly how that works.\n\nAlright, the midpoint formula says that the x-coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the x-coordinates of the two endpoints, and the y-coordinate of the midpoint is the average of the y-coordinates of the two endpoints. So, if I denote the unknown endpoint as (x, y), then I can set up two equations based on the midpoint formula.\n\nFor the x-coordinate: The midpoint's x-coordinate is 3, and one endpoint's x-coordinate is 0. So, according to the formula, (0 + x)\/2 should equal 3. Let me write that down:\n\n(0 + x)\/2 = 3\n\nTo solve for x, I can multiply both sides by 2:\n\n0 + x = 6\n\nSo, x = 6. That gives me the x-coordinate of the other endpoint.\n\nNow, for the y-coordinate: The midpoint's y-coordinate is 7, and one endpoint's y-coordinate is 11. Using the midpoint formula again, (11 + y)\/2 should equal 7. Let me write that equation:\n\n(11 + y)\/2 = 7\n\nTo find y, I'll multiply both sides by 2:\n\n11 + y = 14\n\nThen, subtract 11 from both sides:\n\ny = 14 - 11\n\ny = 3\n\nSo, the y-coordinate of the other endpoint is 3.\n\nPutting it all together, the other endpoint should be at (6, 3). Let me just double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. \n\nFor the x-coordinate: (0 + 6)\/2 = 6\/2 = 3. That matches the midpoint's x-coordinate. \n\nFor the y-coordinate: (11 + 3)\/2 = 14\/2 = 7. That also matches the midpoint's y-coordinate. \n\nLooks like everything checks out. I think I've got the right answer here.\n<\/think>\n\nThe other endpoint of the line segment is \\(\\boxed{(6, 3)}\\).\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet $(x, y)$ be the coordinates of the other endpoint.\nThe midpoint formulas are given by:\n\\[ x_m = \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\]\n\\[ y_m = \\frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}. \\]\n\nGiven:\nMidpoint $(x_m, y_m) = (3, 7)$,\nOne endpoint $(x_1, y_1) = (0, 11)$.\n\nWe need to find $(x, y)$:\nFor the x-coordinate:\n\\[ 3 = \\frac{0 + x}{2} \\implies 6 = 0 + x \\implies x = 6. \\]\n\nFor the y-coordinate:\n\\[ 7 = \\frac{11 + y}{2} \\implies 14 = 11 + y \\implies y = 3. \\]\n\nThus, the other endpoint is $(6, 3)$, so our answer is $\\boxed{(6, 3)}$.\n"}

She is in math class 25% of this time. How many hours per week does she spend in math class?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out how many hours Ruth spends in math class each week. Let me see... Ruth goes to school for 8 hours a day and 5 days a week. So first, I need to find out how many hours she spends at school in total each week. That should be pretty straightforward\u2014just multiply the hours per day by the number of days she goes to school.\n\nAlright, so 8 hours a day times 5 days a week. Let me write that down: 8 * 5. Hmm, 8 times 5 is 40. So Ruth spends 40 hours at school every week. Okay, that part makes sense.\n\nNow, the problem says she is in math class 25% of this time. So I need to find out what 25% of 40 hours is. Percentage problems can sometimes trip me up, but I think I remember that to find a percentage of a number, you convert the percentage to a decimal and then multiply it by the number.\n\nSo, 25% as a decimal is 0.25. Got it. Now, I need to multiply 0.25 by the total number of hours she spends at school, which is 40. Let me write that out: 0.25 * 40. Hmm, 0.25 times 40. I think 0.25 is the same as a quarter, right? So a quarter of 40 hours would be 10 hours. Wait, let me double-check that. 0.25 * 40 equals 10. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, putting it all together, Ruth spends 10 hours per week in math class. Let me just make sure I didn't miss anything. She goes to school 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, totaling 40 hours. She spends 25% of that time in math class, which is 10 hours. Yeah, that adds up.\n\nI guess another way to think about it is breaking down the 25% into fractions. 25% is the same as 1\/4. So, if I take 1\/4 of 40 hours, that's 40 divided by 4, which is also 10. Okay, that confirms it. So, no matter how I approach it, Ruth spends 10 hours each week in math class.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The calculations seem straightforward, and both methods\u2014using decimals and using fractions\u2014give me the same answer. So, I'm pretty confident that 10 hours is the correct amount of time Ruth spends in math class per week.\n<\/think>\n\nRuth spends 10 hours per week in math class.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo solve this problem, we start by calculating the total number of hours Ruth spends at school each week. She goes to school for 8 hours a day and attends 5 days a week. Therefore, the total hours per week can be calculated as follows:\n\n\\[ \\text{Total hours per week} = \\text{hours per day} \\times \\text{days per week} \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total hours per week} = 8 \\times 5 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Total hours per week} = 40 \\]\n\nNext, we calculate the number of hours she spends in math class each week. Since she is in math class for 25% of her school time, we find the math class hours by calculating 25% of the total school hours:\n\n\\[ \\text{Math class hours per week} = \\text{Total hours per week} \\times 25\\% \\]\n\\[ \\text{Math class hours per week} = 40 \\times 0.25 \\]\n\\[ \\text{Math class hours per week} = 10 \\]\n\nTherefore, Ruth spends $\\boxed{10}$ hours per week in math class.\n"}

Only one of the gluten-free vegan dishes is low in sugar. This means there is only one dish that meets all the dietary restrictions: being vegan, gluten-free, and low in sugar.\n\nFinally, to find the fraction of the entire menu that I can eat, I'll take the number of dishes that meet all the restrictions and divide it by the total number of dishes on the menu.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the fraction of dishes on the menu that you can eat while adhering to your dietary restrictions, let's break down the information step by step.\n\n### Given:\n- **Total Vegan Dishes:** 6\n- **Fraction of Vegan Dishes in the Menu:** \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\)\n- **Gluten-Free Vegan Dishes:** \\(6 - 4 = 2\\)\n- **Low-Sugar Gluten-Free Vegan Dishes:** 1\n\n### Step 1: Find the Total Number of Dishes on the Menu\nSince 6 vegan dishes represent \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of the entire menu, we can calculate the total number of dishes (\\(T\\)) as follows:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{4}T = 6\n\\]\n\n\\[\nT = 6 \\times 4 = 24\n\\]\n\nSo, there are **24 dishes** in total on the menu.\n\n### Step 2: Determine the Number of Dishes You Can Eat\nYou are looking for dishes that are:\n- **Vegan**\n- **Gluten-Free**\n- **Low in Sugar**\n\nFrom the given information:\n- **Gluten-Free Vegan Dishes:** 2\n- **Low-Sugar Gluten-Free Vegan Dishes:** 1\n\nTherefore, there is **1 dish** that meets all your dietary restrictions.\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Fraction of Dishes You Can Eat\nThe fraction of dishes you can eat is the number of suitable dishes divided by the total number of dishes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Fraction} = \\frac{1}{24}\n\\]\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n1. Calculate the number of vegan dishes that are also gluten-free:\n   Since six dishes are vegan and four of these contain gluten, $6 - 4 = 2$ vegan dishes are gluten-free.\n\n2. Determine the fraction of the vegan gluten-free dishes that are also low in sugar:\n   Only one of the two gluten-free vegan dishes is low in sugar.\n\n3. Find the fraction of the menu that fits all dietary restrictions:\n   The vegan dishes are $\\frac{1}{4}$ of the total menu. Since there are $6$ vegan dishes, and the total number of dishes is $6 \\div \\frac{1}{4} = 24$. There is 1 dish suitable for all restrictions out of 24 dishes.\n   Thus, the fraction of the menu I can eat is $\\frac{1}{24}$.\n\nConclusion with boxed answer:\nThe fraction of the dishes on the menu that I can eat, considering all my dietary restrictions, is $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{24}}$.\n"}

The relationship given is \\( 2t = m + n \\).\n\nMy goal is to find the number of boxes of grade C in the entire batch of 420 boxes.\n\nTo solve this, I'll start by expressing the total number of boxes as the sum of the boxes in each grade:\n\\[\n\\text{Total boxes} = \\text{Grade A} + \\text{Grade B} + \\text{Grade C} = m + n + t = 420\n\\]\n\nFrom the given equation \\( 2t = m + n \\), I can substitute \\( m + n \\) in the total boxes equation:\n\\[\n2t + t = 420\n\\]\n\\[\n3t = 420\n\\]\n\\[\nt = \\frac{420}{3} = 140\n\\]\n\nTherefore, there are 140 boxes of grade C in the 420 boxes.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the number of boxes of grade \\( C \\) in the 420 boxes, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n\n1. **Total Number of Boxes:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total boxes} = m + n + t = 420\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Given Relationship:**\n   \\[\n   2t = m + n\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Substitute \\( m + n \\) from the second equation into the first equation:**\n   \\[\n   2t + t = 420\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   3t = 420\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( t \\):**\n   \\[\n   t = \\frac{420}{3} = 140\n   \\]\n   \nTherefore, the number of boxes of grade \\( C \\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{140}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n**Analysis**\n\nThis question tests basic stratified sampling, which is a fundamental topic. Sampling is often used in daily life, and it cultivates students' ability to pose statistically valuable questions from real-life situations or other disciplines. From \\\\(2t = m + n\\\\), it is known that the grade \\\\(C\\\\) food accounts for \\\\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\\\) of the total number of boxes, which solves the problem.\n\n**Solution**\n\nGiven \\\\(2t = m + n\\\\), it is known that the grade \\\\(C\\\\) food accounts for \\\\(\\dfrac{1}{3}\\\\) of the total number of boxes.  \nTherefore, the number of grade \\\\(C\\\\) boxes among the 420 boxes is \\\\(420 \\times \\dfrac{1}{3} = 140\\\\).  \nHence, the correct answer is $\\boxed{D}$.\n"}

How many seats were empty?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about a little league stadium. Let me try to understand it step by step. The stadium has a total of 92 seats. On the day of the game, 47 people came to watch. Out of these 47 people, 38 were holding banners. The question is asking how many seats were empty.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out what exactly is being asked. It's about finding the number of empty seats, right? So, if there are 92 seats in total and 47 people came, I might think that the number of empty seats would be 92 minus 47. But wait, the problem also mentions that 38 people were holding banners. Does that information affect the number of empty seats?\n\nLet me think about it. The total number of seats is 92. If 47 people attended the game, then regardless of whether they were holding banners or not, they occupied 47 seats. So, the number of empty seats should be 92 minus 47, which is 45. The fact that 38 people were holding banners might be extra information that doesn't impact the number of empty seats. Maybe it's just there to provide more context about the attendees.\n\nBut just to be sure, maybe I should double-check. If 38 people were holding banners, does that mean they took up more seats or something? No, each person, whether they're holding a banner or not, occupies one seat. So, the number of people is still 47, and the number of empty seats is 92 minus 47, which is 45.\n\nI think that's it. The extra detail about the banners doesn't change the number of empty seats. It's just additional information that doesn't affect the calculation.\n<\/think>\n\nThe problem involves determining the number of empty seats in a stadium with a total of 92 seats, given that 47 people attended the game. The additional information about 38 people holding banners does not affect the calculation since each person, regardless of whether they are holding a banner, occupies one seat.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Total Seats:** 92\n2. **Total Attendees:** 47\n3. **Empty Seats Calculation:** Total Seats - Total Attendees = 92 - 47 = 45\n\n**Answer:** There were 45 empty seats at the game.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nIf 47 people came to the game, then the number of empty seats would be the total number of seats minus the number of people who came. So:\n\n92 seats - 47 people = 45 empty seats\n\nTherefore, there were $\\boxed{45}$  empty seats at the game.\n"}

The options are:\n\nA: 3\n\nB: 2.1\n\nC: 0\n\nD: -2\n\nAlright, let's break this down step by step. First, I need to remember what a positive integer is. From what I recall, positive integers are numbers that are whole numbers greater than zero. So, they don't have any fractions or decimals, and they can't be negative or zero.\n\nLet's look at each option one by one.\n\nStarting with Option A: 3. That's a whole number, and it's greater than zero. So, based on my understanding, 3 should be a positive integer. That seems straightforward.\n\nNext, Option B: 2.1. Hmm, this one is a bit tricky. 2.1 is not a whole number; it's a decimal. Since positive integers must be whole numbers without any fractions or decimals, 2.1 doesn't fit the criteria. So, I think Option B is not a positive integer.\n\nMoving on to Option C: 0. Zero is interesting because it's neither positive nor negative. It's just zero. But the definition of positive integers requires the number to be greater than zero. Since zero isn't greater than zero, it doesn't qualify as a positive integer. So, Option C is out.\n\nFinally, Option D: -2. This is a negative number. Positive integers have to be greater than zero, and negative numbers are definitely not positive. So, Option D is also not a positive integer.\n\nAfter evaluating all the options, it seems like only Option A: 3 fits the definition of a positive integer. The other options either aren't whole numbers, are zero, or are negative.\n\nJust to make sure I'm not missing anything, let me recap:\n\n- Positive integers are whole numbers greater than zero.\n- 3 is a whole number greater than zero.\n- 2.1 is a decimal, not a whole number.\n- 0 is neither positive nor negative.\n- -2 is negative.\n\nYep, that confirms it. Only Option A is a positive integer.\n<\/think>\n\n**Answer:**\n\nAmong the given options, the positive integer is:\n\n**A: 3**\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n- **A: 3** is a whole number greater than zero, making it a positive integer.\n- **B: 2.1** is a decimal and not a whole number, so it is not a positive integer.\n- **C: 0** is neither positive nor negative, thus not a positive integer.\n- **D: -2** is a negative number and therefore not a positive integer.\n\nOnly Option A meets the criteria of being a positive integer.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo determine which of the given options are positive integers, we evaluate each option based on the definition of positive integers. Positive integers are all the whole numbers greater than zero, without fractions or decimals.\n\n- **Option A: $3$**\n  - $3$ is a whole number greater than zero.\n  - Therefore, $3$ is a positive integer.\n  - $\\Rightarrow$ Option A meets the requirements.\n\n- **Option B: $2.1$**\n  - $2.1$ is a decimal number, not a whole number.\n  - Decimal numbers are not considered integers.\n  - $\\Rightarrow$ Option B does not meet the requirements.\n\n- **Option C: $0$**\n  - $0$ is neither positive nor negative.\n  - By definition, positive integers must be greater than zero.\n  - $\\Rightarrow$ Option C does not meet the requirements.\n\n- **Option D: $-2$**\n  - $-2$ is less than zero and is a negative number.\n  - Positive integers cannot be negative.\n  - $\\Rightarrow$ Option D does not meet the requirements.\n\nGiven the evaluations above, only Option A, which is $3$, qualifies as a positive integer according to the question's requirements.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{A}$.\n"}

Hmm, let's see. I remember that simplifying an expression usually means combining like terms. Like terms are terms that have the same variable raised to the same power. So, in this case, I see terms with \\(x\\) and terms with \\(y\\), and there's also a constant number, which is 20.\n\nFirst, I'll look at the \\(x\\) terms: \\(3x\\), \\(6x\\), \\(9x\\), \\(12x\\), and \\(15x\\). These all have the same variable \\(x\\), so I can add their coefficients together. Let me add them one by one:\n\n- \\(3x + 6x\\) is \\(9x\\).\n- Then, \\(9x + 9x\\) is \\(18x\\).\n- Next, \\(18x + 12x\\) is \\(30x\\).\n- Finally, \\(30x + 15x\\) gives me \\(45x\\).\n\nOkay, so all the \\(x\\) terms combined give me \\(45x\\).\n\nNow, looking at the \\(y\\) term, there's only one: \\(4y\\). Since there are no other \\(y\\) terms to combine with, I'll just keep that as it is.\n\nThen there's the constant term, which is 20. There are no other constants to combine with, so that stays as 20.\n\nPutting it all together, I have \\(45x\\) from the \\(x\\) terms, \\(4y\\) from the \\(y\\) term, and the constant 20. So, the simplified expression should be \\(45x + 4y + 20\\).\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything. The original expression was \\(3x + 6x + 9x + 12x + 15x + 20 + 4y\\). Adding up the coefficients of \\(x\\): 3 + 6 is 9, plus 9 is 18, plus 12 is 30, plus 15 is 45. Yep, that looks right. The \\(y\\) term is just 4y, and the constant is 20. So, combining them gives me \\(45x + 4y + 20\\).\n\nI think that's it. I don't see any like terms left to combine, so this should be the simplified form of the expression.\n<\/think>\n\nThe simplified expression is \\(45x + 4y + 20\\).\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo simplify the given expression:\n1. Combine like terms for \\(x\\):\n   \\[\n   3x + 6x + 9x + 12x + 15x = (3+6+9+12+15)x = 45x\n   \\]\n2. Sum the constants:\n   \\[\n   20 + 4y = 20 + 4y \\quad \\text{(cannot be simplified further as they involve different variables)}\n   \\]\n3.

Let's take them one at a time. The first one is (+17) + (-12). Hmm, adding a positive and a negative number. I remember that when you add a positive and a negative, it's like subtracting the smaller number from the bigger one and keeping the sign of the bigger number. So, 17 is positive and 12 is negative. Since 17 is bigger than 12, I think the result will be positive. Let me do the subtraction: 17 minus 12 is 5. So, the answer should be +5. That seems straightforward.\n\nNow, the second problem is a bit trickier: -1\/7 minus (-6\/7). Okay, subtracting a negative is like adding a positive, right? So, -1\/7 minus (-6\/7) becomes -1\/7 plus 6\/7. Now, adding these two fractions. Both have the same denominator, which is 7, so that makes it easier. I just need to add the numerators: -1 plus 6 is 5. So, the fraction becomes 5\/7. That should be the answer. Wait, let me double-check. If I have -1\/7 and I add 6\/7, it's like starting at -1\/7 on a number line and moving up 6\/7. That would land me at 5\/7. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I've got both problems figured out. The first one is definitely 5, and the second one is 5\/7. I don't see any mistakes in my reasoning, but maybe I should visualize it to be sure. For the first problem, imagine having 17 apples and losing 12 of them. You'd be left with 5 apples. For the second problem, if I owe someone 1\/7 of a dollar and then they give me back 6\/7, I end up with 5\/7 of a dollar. Yeah, that checks out. I'm confident with these answers.\n<\/think>\n\n**Problem 1:**\n\\[\n(+17) + (-12) = 17 - 12 = 5\n\\]\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{5}\\)\n\n**Problem 2:**\n\\[\n-\\frac{1}{7} - \\left(-\\frac{6}{7}\\right) = -\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7} = \\frac{5}{7}\n\\]\n**Answer:** \\(\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}\\)\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nFor the given problems, let's break down the solutions step by step:\n\n### Problem 1: $(+17) + (-12)$\n\nWe start with the given expression:\n\n$$\n(+17) + (-12)\n$$\n\nAdding the numbers directly, considering that adding a negative number is equivalent to subtraction:\n\n$$\n= 17 - 12\n$$\n\nPerforming the subtraction:\n\n$$\n= 5\n$$\n\nTherefore, the solution to the first problem is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$\n\n### Problem 2: $-\\frac{1}{7} - \\left(-\\frac{6}{7}\\right)$\n\nStarting with the given expression:\n\n$$\n-\\frac{1}{7} - \\left(-\\frac{6}{7}\\right)\n$$\n\nSubtracting a negative is the same as adding, so we rewrite the expression:\n\n$$\n= -\\frac{1}{7} + \\frac{6}{7}\n$$\n\nAdding the fractions, since they have the same denominator:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{-1 + 6}{7}\n$$\n\nSimplifying the numerator:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{5}{7}\n$$\n\nThus, the solution to the second problem is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{5}{7}}\n$$\n\nThese step-by-step solutions follow the original answers closely, breaking down each operation for clarity.\n"}

The options are Quadrant I, II, III, or IV. Hmm, I remember that the Cartesian plane is divided into four quadrants, and each quadrant has specific signs for the x and y coordinates. Let me try to recall how that works.\n\nFirst, Quadrant I is where both x and y are positive. That's the top-right section of the graph. Then, Quadrant II is where x is negative and y is positive, which would be the top-left section. Quadrant III is where both x and y are negative, so that's the bottom-left part, and Quadrant IV is where x is positive and y is negative, which is the bottom-right section.\n\nGiven the point A(-1, -3), I need to figure out the signs of its x and y coordinates. The x-coordinate is -1, which is negative, and the y-coordinate is -3, also negative. So both coordinates are negative. Looking back at the quadrants, Quadrant III is the one where both x and y are negative. That must be where point A is located.\n\nWait, let me double-check. If I plot this point on the Cartesian plane, starting from the origin (0,0), moving left 1 unit because the x-coordinate is -1, and then down 3 units because the y-coordinate is -3, I would end up in the bottom-left section of the graph, which is indeed Quadrant III. Yeah, that makes sense.\n\nI think I got it right. So, the point A(-1, -3) is in Quadrant III.\n<\/think>\n\nThe point A(-1, -3) is located in Quadrant III of the Cartesian coordinate system. This is because both the x-coordinate (-1) and the y-coordinate (-3) are negative, which corresponds to the bottom-left section of the graph. \n\n**Answer:** Quadrant III\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nIn the Cartesian coordinate system, each quadrant is defined by the signs of the $x$ and $y$ coordinates:\n\n- Quadrant I: $x > 0$, $y > 0$\n- Quadrant II: $x < 0$, $y > 0$\n- Quadrant III: $x < 0$, $y < 0$\n- Quadrant IV: $x > 0$, $y < 0$\n\nGiven the point $A(-1,-3)$, we can analyze its coordinates:\n\n- The $x$ coordinate is $-1$, which is less than $0$.\n- The $y$ coordinate is $-3$, which is also less than $0$.\n\nSince both coordinates are negative, the point $A(-1,-3)$ is located in the third quadrant, which corresponds to:\n\n- Quadrant III: $x < 0$, $y < 0$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n"}

Let the vertices be labeled \\( A, B, C, D, E, \\) and \\( F \\). \n\nIn a regular hexagon, the vertices that are directly opposite each other are the farthest apart and can serve as endpoints of a diameter. These pairs are \\( (A, D) \\), \\( (B, E) \\), and \\( (C, F) \\). Each of these pairs forms a diameter of the hexagon and thus can be the endpoints of a circle's diameter.\n\nSince all these diameters are of equal length and pass through the center of the hexagon, they all define the same circle. Therefore, despite there being three pairs of vertices that can form diameters, they all result in the same circle.\n\nThus, the number of distinct circles is 1.\n\nThe final answer is \\(\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A) \\ }1}\\).\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n1. **Identify the vertices of the hexagon**: Let the vertices of regular hexagon $H$ be labeled as $A$, $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$, and $F$. Assume $ABCDEF$ is a regular hexagon.\n\n2. **Count the pairs of vertices**: To form a circle, the endpoints need to be at the maximum distance in this shape - the diameter of the hexagon. Vertices that are directly opposite in a regular hexagon can be taken as $(A, D)$, $(B, E)$, and $(C, F)$, as these are the pairs that are farthest apart.\n\n3. **Analyze the circles and determine uniqueness**:\n   - Pairs $(A, D)$, $(B, E)$, and $(C, F)$ are all diameters of the hexagon. In a regular hexagon, all these pairs are equally spaced and diametrically opposite in the hexagon.\n   - Since the distances are the same for all these diameters and they cut through the center, each of these pairs forms a circle with the same size centered at the center of the hexagon.\n\n4. **Count the distinct circles**: Since they all share the same size and center, all the pairs $(A, D)$, $(B, E)$, and $(C, F)$ form exactly the same circle.\n\nThe number of circles in the plane of $H$ that have a diameter, both of which endpoints are vertices of $H$, is $1$.\n\nConclusion:\nThe solution shows that in the case of a regular hexagon, even though multiple vertex pairs can be dialed up as prospective endpoints for circles, the structural symmetry leads to having all diametrically opposite pairs define a single unique circle. Therefore, the method confirms that only one circle satisfies the requirements in this geometric scenario.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\mathrm{(A) \\ }1}$\n"}

{"text":"\nyou are a mathematics expert,skilled in solving methematical problems and logical reasoning.\nPlease read the question carefully and provide detailed solution steps.\n\n<|Question|>\nIf $|m|=|-7|$, then $m=$____.\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this equation here: |m| = |-7|. Hmm, I need to figure out what m is. Alright, let's start by understanding what absolute value means. Absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, right? So, it's always non-negative, meaning it's either positive or zero.\n\nFirst, let's evaluate |-7|. Since absolute value makes any number inside it non-negative, |-7| should be 7. So, the equation simplifies to |m| = 7. Now, I need to find all values of m that make this equation true.\n\nI remember that if |x| = a, then x can be a or -a. So, applying that here, if |m| = 7, then m can be 7 or -7. Let me double-check that. If m is 7, then |7| is 7, which matches. If m is -7, then |-7| is also 7, which still matches. So, both 7 and -7 satisfy the equation.\n\nWait, could there be any other numbers that satisfy |m| = 7? Let me think. If m is a positive number, it's just m. If it's negative, it's the opposite of m. So, the only numbers that are 7 units away from zero on the number line are 7 and -7. There's no other number that would give an absolute value of 7.\n\nSo, putting it all together, m can be either 7 or -7. Therefore, the solutions are m = 7 and m = -7. I think that's it. I don't see any other possibilities, and my reasoning seems solid. I considered both the positive and negative scenarios, and both work. So, yeah, m must be either 7 or -7.\n<\/think>\n\nThe equation |m| = |-7| simplifies to |m| = 7. Since the absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, m can be either 7 or -7. Therefore, the solutions are:\n\nm = 7 or m = -7\n\n**Answer:** m = \u00b17\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nGiven that $|m| = |-7|$, we want to find the value of $m$.\n\nFirst, we know that the absolute value of a number is always non-negative. Therefore, $|-7| = 7$ because the absolute value of $-7$ is the distance of $-7$ from $0$ on the number line, which is $7$.\n\nGiven that $|m| = |-7|$, we can substitute the value we found for $|-7|$ into the equation:\n$$|m| = 7$$\n\nThe absolute value equation $|m| = 7$ means that $m$ can be either $7$ or $-7$ because both $7$ and $-7$ are $7$ units away from $0$ on the number line.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that:\n$$m = \\pm 7$$\n\nEncapsulating the final answer:\n$$\\boxed{m = \\pm 7}$$\n"}

Set A is {0, 1}, and set B is {-1, 1}. I need to find the intersection of A and B, which is written as A \u2229 B. Alright, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember that the intersection of two sets consists of all elements that are common to both sets. So, I need to look at each element in set A and see if it's also in set B. If it is, then that element belongs to the intersection.\n\nLet's list out the elements of set A: 0 and 1. Now, let's look at set B: -1 and 1. I'll go through each element in A and check if it's in B.\n\nStarting with the first element in A, which is 0. Is 0 in set B? Set B has -1 and 1, so no, 0 is not in B. That means 0 doesn't belong to the intersection.\n\nNext, the second element in A is 1. Is 1 in set B? Yes, because set B has 1 as one of its elements. So, 1 is common to both sets A and B, which means it belongs to the intersection.\n\nNow, I've checked all elements in set A, and only 1 is present in both A and B. Therefore, the intersection of A and B is the set containing just the element 1.\n\nI think that's it. To make sure I didn't miss anything, I'll double-check. Set A has 0 and 1, set B has -1 and 1. The only common element is 1. Yep, that seems correct. So, the intersection A \u2229 B is {1}.\n<\/think>\n\nThe intersection of sets A and B, denoted as A \u2229 B, consists of all elements that are common to both sets. \n\nGiven:\n- Set A = {0, 1}\n- Set B = {-1, 1}\n\nTo find A \u2229 B:\n1. Identify elements in set A: 0 and 1.\n2. Check each element to see if it is also in set B.\n   - 0 is not in set B.\n   - 1 is in set B.\n\nTherefore, the only common element is 1.\n\n**Answer:**  \nA \u2229 B = {1}\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nWe are given sets A={0, 1} and B={-1, 1}. We want to find their intersection, A\u2229B.\n\nThe intersection of two sets, A and B, is the set containing elements that belong to both A and B.\n\nIn this case, only the number 1 belongs to both sets A and B. Therefore, A\u2229B contains just one element, which is 1.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\n$$A\u2229B=\\boxed{\\{1\\}}.$$\n\nTo solve this problem, we directly used the definition of the intersection of two sets. This problem tests our understanding of the intersection definition and our ability to apply set operations. It is a fundamental problem.\n"}

He makes 8 sandwiches in total, using two slices of bread each.  How many packs of bread does he need to buy to make these sandwiches, assuming he starts with no bread and each pack has 4 slices of bread in it?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so Jimmy is making sandwiches for a picnic, and he wants to make 8 sandwiches. Each sandwich requires 2 slices of bread. I need to figure out how many packs of bread he needs to buy, assuming he starts with no bread and each pack has 4 slices.\n\nFirst, I should calculate the total number of bread slices needed. Since each sandwich uses 2 slices, for 8 sandwiches, that would be 8 times 2. Let me write that down: 8 sandwiches * 2 slices per sandwich = 16 slices of bread.\n\nNow, each pack contains 4 slices. To find out how many packs Jimmy needs, I should divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pack. So, 16 slices \/ 4 slices per pack = 4 packs.\n\nWait, does that make sense? If each pack has 4 slices, and he needs 16 slices, then 4 packs would give him exactly 16 slices. That seems right.

The answer is 2. What is the divisor?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nFirst, I need to determine the divisor that makes the number 433124 divisible when the least number, which is 2, is added to it.\n\nAdding 2 to 433124 gives:\n433124 + 2 = 433126\n\nNext, I need to find the divisor that makes 433126 divisible. Since 433126 is an even number, it is divisible by 2. To confirm, I divide 433126 by 2:\n433126 \u00f7 2 = 216563\n\nSince the division results in a whole number, 216563, it confirms that 433126 is divisible by 2. Therefore, the divisor is 2.\n<\/think>\n\nTo find the divisor, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Add the Least Number to 433124:**\n   \n   The least number to be added is **2**.\n   \n   \\[\n   433124 + 2 = 433126\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the Divisor:**\n   \n   We need to find the divisor that makes **433126** divisible.

Since 433126 is an even number, we know that it is divisible by 2. However, we need to find the specific divisor that was intended in the question.\n\nTo do this, we can check the divisibility of 433126 by various numbers. Since the least number added was 2, it suggests that the divisor might be a factor of 2 or a number close to a multiple of 433124.\n\nLet's check if 433126 is divisible by numbers close to 433124:\n\n- 433124 is not a prime number, so we can rule out prime numbers as potential divisors.\n- We can start by checking divisibility by small factors of 2, such as 4, 8, 16, etc.\n\nLet's check divisibility by 4:\n433126 \u00f7 4 = 108281.5 (not divisible)\n\nLet's check divisibility by 8:\n433126 \u00f7 8 = 54140.75 (not divisible)\n\nSince the number is even, we know it is divisible by 2. However, we need to find the specific divisor that was intended. The question states that the least number that must be added to 433124 to make it divisible by a certain number is 2. This implies that 433124 is just 2 less than a multiple of the divisor.\n\nLet's check if 433126 is divisible by larger factors of 2:\n433126 \u00f7 2 = 216563 (divisible)\n\nSince 433126 is divisible by 2, and adding 2 to 433124 made it divisible by this number, the divisor we are looking for is $\\boxed{2}$ .\n"}

The difference between y and x is:\n\ndifference = y - x\ndifference = 160 - 100\ndifference = 60\n\nTo find out what percentage this difference is of y, we use the formula:\n\npercentage = (difference \/ y) * 100\npercentage = (60 \/ 160) * 100\npercentage = 0.375 * 100\npercentage = 37.5\n\nSo, x is $\\boxed{37.5\\%}$  less than y.\n"}

The new total weight is the original total weight plus the increase in total weight, minus the weight of the person being replaced, plus the weight of the new person.\n\nFinally, I'll solve the equation to find the weight of the new person.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the weight of the new person, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Problem:**\n   - There are **8 people** initially.\n   - The average weight increases by **2.5 kg** when a new person replaces one of the original people who weighs **55 kg**.\n   - We need to find the weight of the new person.\n\n2. **Calculate the Increase in Total Weight:**\n   \n   The average weight increase per person is **2.5 kg**. Since there are **8 people**, the total increase in weight is:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Increase} = 8 \\times 2.5\\,\\text{kg} = 20\\,\\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation:**\n   \n   Let \\( x \\) be the weight of the new person. The new person replaces a person who weighs **55 kg**. Therefore, the increase in total weight can be expressed as:\n   \n   \\[\n   x - 55\\,\\text{kg} = 20\\,\\text{kg}\n   \\]\n   \n4. **Solve for \\( x \\):**\n   \n   \\[\n   x = 55\\,\\text{kg} + 20\\,\\text{kg} = 75\\,\\text{kg}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   The weight of the new person is \\(\\boxed{75}\\) kg.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the total weight of the original 8 people as W. When the new person replaces one of them, the total weight becomes W - 55 + x, where x is the weight of the new person.\n\nThe average weight of the 8 people increases by 2.5 kg, which means the total weight increases by 8 * 2.5 kg. So we have:\n\nW - 55 + x = W + (8 * 2.5)\n\nNow we can solve for x:\n\nx = 55 + (8 * 2.5)\nx = 55 + 20\nx = 75 kg\n\nThe weight of the new person is $\\boxed{75}$  kg.\n"}

To make this easier, I'll let the amount paid to Y be represented by Y.\n\nSince X is paid 120% of Y, I can express X's payment as 1.2Y.\n\nNow, I can set up an equation that represents the total payment:\nY (for Y) + 1.2Y (for X) = 560\n\nCombining like terms, this simplifies to:\n2.2Y = 560\n\nTo find Y, I'll divide both sides of the equation by 2.2:\nY = 560 \/ 2.2\n\nCalculating this gives:\nY = 254.545454545...\n\nSince we're dealing with currency, I'll round this to the nearest whole number:\nY \u2248 Rs. 255\n\nTherefore, Y is paid approximately Rs. 255 per week.\n<\/think>\n\nLet's determine how much Y is paid per week.\n\n**Given:**\n- Total payment to both employees per week: Rs. 560\n- X is paid 120% of what Y is paid.\n\n**Step 1: Define Variables**\n- Let the amount paid to Y be \\( Y \\) rupees.\n- Therefore, the amount paid to X is \\( 120\\% \\) of \\( Y \\), which can be written as:\n  \\[\n  X = \\frac{120}{100} \\times Y = 1.2Y\n  \\]\n\n**Step 2: Set Up the Equation**\nThe total payment to both employees is the sum of what X and Y are paid:\n\\[\nX + Y = 560\n\\]\nSubstitute \\( X \\) with \\( 1.2Y \\):\n\\[\n1.2Y + Y = 560\n\\]\n\n**Step 3: Combine Like Terms**\n\\[\n2.2Y = 560\n\\]\n\n**Step 4: Solve for \\( Y \\)**\n\\[\nY = \\frac{560}{2.2} = 254.545454545\\ldots\n\\]\n\nSince we're dealing with currency, it's appropriate to round to the nearest whole number:\n\\[\nY \\approx 255 \\text{ rupees}\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{255}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the amount paid to Y per week as Rs. Y.\n\nSince X is paid 120 percent of the sum paid to Y, the amount paid to X per week is 120\/100 * Y = 1.2Y.\n\nThe total amount paid to both employees per week is Rs. 560.\n\nTherefore, we can write the equation as:\nY + 1.2Y = 560\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n2.2Y = 560\n\nTo find the amount paid to Y, we divide both sides of the equation by 2.2:\nY = 560 \/ 2.2\n\nY = 254.545454545...\n\nSince we're dealing with currency, we'll round to the nearest whole number:\nY \u2248 Rs. 255\n\nSo, Y is paid approximately Rs. $\\boxed{255}$  per week.\n"}

She eats 2 on the way, and we need to see which of the situations A to E could happen. Let me go through each option one by one.\n\nStarting with option A: Grandmother did not receive any chocolate sweets. Hmm, Sofia started with 3 chocolate sweets. If she eats 2, the worst case is she eats both chocolate sweets, leaving 1. But even if she doesn't eat any chocolate, there are still 3 left. So, it's impossible for the grandmother to receive no chocolate sweets. So, A is not possible.\n\nMoving on to B: Grandmother received fewer coconut sweets than chocolate sweets. Initially, there are 6 coconut and 3 chocolate. If Sofia eats 2 sweets, even if she eats 2 coconut sweets, there would still be 4 coconut left. The chocolate sweets would be at least 1, so 4 is still more than 1. Therefore, B is also not possible.\n\nOption C: Grandmother received the same number of sweets of each of the 3 varieties. Let's see. The total number of sweets is 7 + 6 + 3 = 16. Sofia eats 2, so grandmother gets 14. If they were all equal, each variety would have 14\/3 \u2248 4.666, which isn't possible since we can't have a fraction of a sweet. So, C is not possible.\n\nOption D: There are 2 varieties of sweets of which grandmother received the same number. Let's think. Suppose Sofia eats 1 blackberry and 1 chocolate. Then, blackberry would be 6, coconut 6, and chocolate 2. So, blackberry and coconut are both 6. That's possible. So, D is possible.\n\nOption E: The number of blackberry sweets grandmother received is greater than the sum of the other 2 kinds. Let's check. The maximum blackberry sweets grandmother could get is 7 - 2 = 5. The other two kinds would be 6 + 3 - 0 = 9. 5 is not greater than 9. So, E is not possible.\n\nSo, after going through each option, only D seems possible.\n<\/think>\n\nThe only possible situation is:\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n\nLet's analyze each of the proposed scenarios.

{"text":"\nyou are a mathematics expert,skilled in solving methematical problems and logical reasoning.\nPlease read the question carefully and provide detailed solution steps.\n\n<|Question|>\nAt Mrs. Hilt's house, there was 29 inches of snow, and Brecknock Elementary School received some amount of snow. Mrs. Hilt's house had 12 inches more snow. How many inches of snow were there at Brecknock Elementary School?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here about snowfall at Mrs. Hilt's house and Brecknock Elementary School. Let me try to understand what's being asked.\n\nFirst, it says that Mrs. Hilt's house had 29 inches of snow. Then, Brecknock Elementary School received some amount of snow, but it doesn't specify how much. The key part is that Mrs. Hilt's house had 12 inches more snow than the school. So, I need to figure out how much snow the school got.\n\nAlright, let's break it down. Mrs. Hilt's snow is 29 inches, and that's 12 inches more than the school's snow. So, if I think about it, the school's snow amount plus 12 inches equals Mrs. Hilt's snow amount. In other words, school snow + 12 inches = 29 inches.\n\nTo find out the school's snow, I need to subtract the extra 12 inches from Mrs. Hilt's total. So, 29 inches minus 12 inches should give me the amount of snow at the school.\n\nLet me do the math: 29 minus 12 is 17. So, the school received 17 inches of snow.\n\nWait, let me double-check to make sure I didn't make a mistake. If the school had 17 inches, and Mrs. Hilt's house had 12 inches more, then 17 plus 12 is indeed 29. That matches the given information, so it seems correct.\n\nI think that's the right answer. The school had 17 inches of snow.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the amount of snow at Brecknock Elementary School, we can set up an equation based on the information provided.\n\nLet \\( x \\) represent the amount of snow at Brecknock Elementary School.\n\nAccording to the problem:\n\\[\n\\text{Mrs. Hilt's snow} = \\text{School's snow} + 12 \\text{ inches}\n\\]\nSubstituting the known value:\n\\[\n29 = x + 12\n\\]\nSolving for \\( x \\):\n\\[\nx = 29 - 12 = 17\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Brecknock Elementary School received \\(\\boxed{17}\\) inches of snow.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nIf Mrs. Hilt's house had 29 inches of snow and that was 12 inches more than what Brecknock Elementary School received, then we can find out how much snow was at the school by subtracting the extra amount from Mrs. Hilt's total.\n\n29 inches (at Mrs. Hilt's house) - 12 inches (the extra amount) = $\\boxed{17}$  inches of snow at Brecknock Elementary School.\n"}

The student aims to score 70% in the third subject to reach a certain overall average.\n\nTo find the overall average, I will add the scores of all three subjects and then divide by the number of subjects.\n\nSo, I will add 74%, 81%, and 70% to get the total percentage.\n\nNext, I will divide this total by 3 to calculate the average percentage.\n\nFinally, this will give me the desired overall average percentage.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the desired overall average percentage, follow these steps:\n\n1. **List the given percentages:**\n   - **Math:** 74%\n   - **History:** 81%\n   - **Third Subject:** 70%\n\n2. **Calculate the total percentage:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Percentage} = 74\\% + 81\\% + 70\\% = 225\\%\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the overall average percentage:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\text{Overall Average} = \\frac{\\text{Total Percentage}}{\\text{Number of Subjects}} = \\frac{225\\%}{3} = 75\\%\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{75\\%}\n   \\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the desired overall average percentage as \"A\" and the percentage the student needs to get in the third subject as \"T\" (which is given as 70%).\n\nThe overall average is calculated by adding the percentages of all subjects and dividing by the number of subjects. In this case, there are three subjects. So the formula for the overall average is:\n\nA = (Math percentage + History percentage + Third subject percentage) \/ 3\n\nWe know the Math percentage is 74%, the History percentage is 81%, and the Third subject percentage is 70%. Plugging these values into the formula, we get:\n\nA = (74 + 81 + 70) \/ 3\n\nNow, let's calculate the sum of the percentages:\n\n74 + 81 + 70 = 225\n\nNow, we divide this sum by 3 to find the overall average:\n\nA = 225 \/ 3\nA = 75\n\nSo, the desired overall average percentage is $\\boxed{75\\%}$ .\n"}

Since the tosses are independent, the probability of getting tails in all three tosses is (1\/2)\u00b3 = 1\/8.\n\nTherefore, the probability of getting at least one head is 1 - 1\/8 = 7\/8.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the probability of getting **heads** at least once when tossing a coin three times, we can use the complementary probability approach. Here's a step-by-step solution:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Possible Outcomes:**\n   \n   Each coin toss has two possible outcomes: **Heads (H)** or **Tails (T)**. When tossing the coin three times, the total number of possible outcomes is:\n   \n   \\[\n   2^3 = 8\n   \\]\n   \n   These outcomes are:\n   \n   \\[\n   \\{HHH,\\ HHT,\\ HTH,\\ HTT,\\ THH,\\ THT,\\ TTH,\\ TTT\\}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Calculate the Probability of the Complementary Event:**\n   \n   Instead of directly calculating the probability of getting **at least one head**, it's easier to calculate the probability of the complementary event, which is getting **no heads** (i.e., all tails), and then subtracting this probability from 1.\n   \n   The probability of getting tails in a single toss is:\n   \n   \\[\n   P(T) = \\frac{1}{2}\n   \\]\n   \n   Since the tosses are independent, the probability of getting tails in all three tosses is:\n   \n   \\[\n   P(\\text{No Heads}) = P(T) \\times P(T) \\times P(T) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Desired Probability:**\n   \n   The probability of getting **at least one head** is the complement of getting no heads:\n   \n   \\[\n   P(\\text{At Least One Head}) = 1 - P(\\text{No Heads}) = 1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\dfrac{7}{8}}\n   \\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet the random variable $X$ denote the \"number of times heads is facing up.\" Then $X$ follows a binomial distribution, that is, $X \\sim B(3, \\frac{1}{2})$.  \nThe probability that heads comes up at least once can be calculated by subtracting the probability of no heads coming up from 1:  \n$$P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - P(X = 0)$$  \nSince each toss is independent and the probability of getting heads (or tails) in a single toss is $\\frac{1}{2}$, we calculate $P(X = 0)$ as the product of probabilities of getting tails in all three tosses:  \n$$P(X = 0) = \\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^3 = \\frac{1}{8}$$  \nNow, we can subtract this from 1 to find the probability of getting heads at least once:  \n$$P(X \\geq 1) = 1 - \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$$  \nSo the probability of getting heads at least once when tossing the coin three times is \\boxed{\\frac{7}{8}}. Mastering the binomial distribution is key to solving this type of problem.\n"}

{"text":"\nyou are a mathematics expert,skilled in solving methematical problems and logical reasoning.\nPlease read the question carefully and provide detailed solution steps.\n\n<|Question|>\nOlaf is sailing across the ocean with 25 men, including himself. He needs 1\/2 a gallon of water per day per man. The boat can go 200 miles per day and he needs to travel 4,000 miles. How many gallons of water does he need?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out how many gallons of water Olaf and his crew need for their journey. Let me start by understanding the problem step by step.\n\nFirst, there are 25 men on the boat, including Olaf. Each man needs half a gallon of water per day. So, I guess I need to calculate the total water consumption per day for all the men combined.\n\nIf one man needs 0.5 gallons per day, then for 25 men, it would be 25 times 0.5 gallons. Let me write that down:\n\n25 men * 0.5 gallons\/day\/man = 12.5 gallons\/day\n\nOkay, so they need 12.5 gallons of water every day.\n\nNext, I need to find out how many days the journey will take. The boat can travel 200 miles per day, and they need to cover 4,000 miles. So, I think I can find the number of days by dividing the total distance by the daily distance:\n\n4,000 miles \/ 200 miles\/day = 20 days\n\nSo, the journey will take 20 days.\n\nNow, to find the total amount of water needed for the entire trip, I can multiply the daily water consumption by the number of days:\n\n12.5 gallons\/day * 20 days = 250 gallons\n\nWait, that seems straightforward. But let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss anything.\n\nFirst, confirming the daily water requirement: 25 men * 0.5 gallons\/day\/man = 12.5 gallons\/day. Yep, that looks right.\n\nNext, the duration of the journey: 4,000 miles \/ 200 miles\/day = 20 days. That also makes sense.\n\nFinally, total water needed: 12.5 gallons\/day * 20 days = 250 gallons. Okay, that seems consistent.\n\nI don't think there's anything else to consider here. The problem doesn't mention any additional factors like water usage for other purposes or potential water sources along the way. So, based on the information provided, 250 gallons should be the total amount of water needed for the journey.\n<\/think>\n\nOlaf and his crew need a total of 250 gallons of water for their 20-day journey across 4,000 miles of ocean. This calculation is based on the daily water requirement of 12.5 gallons for 25 men, multiplied by the 20 days of travel.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo solve this problem, we'll break it down into smaller, more manageable parts:\n\n1. **Calculate the daily water requirement for the crew:**\n\n   Each man requires $1\/2$ gallon of water per day. With 25 men on board, including Olaf, the daily water requirement can be calculated as follows:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Daily water requirement} = 25 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 12.5 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the duration of the journey:**\n\n   The boat travels at a speed of 200 miles per day, and the total distance to be covered is 4,000 miles. Therefore, the duration of the journey can be calculated by dividing the total distance by the daily travel distance:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Duration of the journey} = \\frac{4,000}{200} = 20 \\text{ days}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate the total water requirement for the journey:**\n\n   Knowing the daily water requirement and the duration of the journey, we can calculate the total water requirement by multiplying these two values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total water requirement} = 20 \\times 12.5 = 250 \\text{ gallons}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the total amount of water needed for the journey is $\\boxed{250 \\text{ gallons}}$.\n"}

What is the maximum number of tickets Jane can buy?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nFirst, I need to determine how many tickets Jane can buy without any discount. Each ticket costs $18, and Jane has $150. Dividing her total money by the cost per ticket gives me the maximum number of tickets she can purchase without a discount.\n\nNext, I consider the scenario where Jane buys more than 5 tickets to qualify for the 10% discount.

Let $n$ denote the number of tickets Jane buys.\n2. Without discounts, each ticket costs $18$, so $18n$ dollars is needed for $n$ tickets. Thus, $(18n) \\leq 150$ without any discount.\n3. If Jane buys more than 5 tickets, $(18 \\times 0.9) n = 16.2n$ (this includes the 10% discount).\n   \\begin{align*}\n   (18 \\times 5) + (16.2)n &\\leq 150 \\quad \\text{(for } n > 5).\n   \\end{align*}\n4. For $n \\leq 5$, solve:\n   $$\n   18n \\leq 150 \\implies n \\leq \\frac{150}{18} = 8.33\n   $$\n   Since tickets are integers, she can buy up to 8 tickets without a discount.\n5.

Find $A \\cap B$.\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem where I need to find the intersection of two sets, A and B. Set A is given as {-1, 0, 1}, which is pretty straightforward. Set B is defined as all real numbers x such that x equals m squared plus 1, where m is any real number. Hmm, okay, so B is the set of all numbers you can get by taking some real number, squaring it, and then adding 1. \n\nLet me think about what B actually looks like. If m is any real number, then m squared is always going to be non-negative because squaring any real number gives a positive result or zero. So, m squared is greater than or equal to zero. If I add 1 to that, then x = m\u00b2 + 1 is going to be greater than or equal to 1. That means the smallest number in set B is 1, and all other numbers in B are bigger than 1. So, B is the interval [1, \u221e) on the number line.\n\nNow, set A has three elements: -1, 0, and 1. I need to find the intersection of A and B, which means I'm looking for elements that are in both A and B. Let's check each element of A to see if it's also in B.\n\nStarting with -1: Is -1 in B? Well, since B starts at 1 and goes up, -1 is definitely not in B. So, -1 is out.\n\nNext, 0: Is 0 in B? Again, B starts at 1, so 0 isn't in B either. So, 0 is also out.\n\nFinally, 1: Is 1 in B? Yes, because when m is 0, m squared is 0, and adding 1 gives 1. So, 1 is in B.\n\nTherefore, the only element common to both sets A and B is 1. That means the intersection of A and B is just the set containing 1.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If m is any real number, m squared is non-negative, so m squared plus 1 is at least 1. So, B is [1, \u221e). A is {-1, 0, 1}. The only overlap is 1. Yep, that seems right.\n\nI don't think I made any mistakes here. The logic seems solid. So, the intersection should indeed be {1}.\n<\/think>\n\nThe intersection of sets A and B is the set containing the element 1, as it is the only common element between the two sets.\n\n**Answer:**  \nThe intersection of sets A and B is \\boxed{\\{1\\}}.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nGiven the definition of set $B$, for any real number $m$, $m^2 \\geq 0$. Therefore, $m^2 + 1 \\geq 1$. This implies that the smallest value in set $B$ is 1, and all other values are greater than 1. Since set $A$ contains -1, 0, and 1, the intersection of sets $A$ and $B$ is the set that contains only the element that both sets have in common, which is 1. \n\nThus, $A \\cap B = \\boxed{\\{1\\}}$.\n"}

His farm supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs and another store with 30 eggs each day. How many eggs does he supply these two stores in a week?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem about Mark and his egg farm. It says he supplies one store with 5 dozen eggs and another store with 30 eggs each day. I need to find out how many eggs he supplies to these two stores in a week. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that a dozen means 12 eggs. So, if Mark supplies 5 dozen eggs to one store, that should be 5 times 12. Let me write that down: 5 x 12. Okay, 5 times 12 is 60. So, he supplies 60 eggs to the first store every day.\n\nThen, he also supplies another store with 30 eggs each day. So, I need to add those 30 eggs to the 60 eggs from the first store to find out the total number of eggs he supplies daily. That would be 60 + 30. Let me calculate that: 60 + 30 equals 90. So, Mark supplies a total of 90 eggs to both stores each day.\n\nNow, the question asks for the total number of eggs supplied in a week. I know that a week has 7 days, so I need to multiply the daily supply by 7. That would be 90 x 7. Let me do that multiplication: 90 times 7 is 630. So, Mark supplies a total of 630 eggs to both stores in a week.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. Starting with the first store: 5 dozen eggs. A dozen is 12, so 5 x 12 is indeed 60 eggs. Then, the second store gets 30 eggs each day. Adding those together: 60 + 30 equals 90 eggs per day. Over 7 days, that would be 90 x 7, which is 630 eggs. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nI think I've got it. Mark supplies a total of 630 eggs to both stores in a week.\n<\/think>\n\nMark supplies a total of **630 eggs** to both stores in a week.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo calculate the total number of eggs Mark's farm supplies to the two stores in a week, we follow these steps:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many eggs are supplied to one store each day. Since a dozen equals 12 eggs, and Mark supplies 5 dozen eggs to one store, the calculation is as follows:\n\\[5 \\times 12 = 60 \\text{ eggs}\\]\n\n2. Next, we add the 30 eggs supplied to the other store to find the total daily supply to both stores:\n\\[60 + 30 = 90 \\text{ eggs}\\]\n\n3. Finally, to find the total supply in a week, we multiply the daily supply by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week):\n\\[90 \\times 7 = 630 \\text{ eggs}\\]\n\nTherefore, the total number of eggs supplied to the two stores in a week is $\\boxed{630}$ eggs.\n"}

These are the odd numbers starting from 21 up to 119.\n\nNext, I observe that among these numbers, there are several multiples of 5: 25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105, and 115. Each of these numbers ends with a 5.\n\nWhen multiplying any number by a number ending in 5, the resulting product will always end with a 5. This is because multiplying by 5 introduces a factor of 5, and since there are multiple such numbers in the sequence, the overall product must end with 5.\n\nTherefore, the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 20 and 120 is 5.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the units digit of the product of all the odd positive integers between 20 and 120, let's follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Odd Numbers:**\n   \n   The odd positive integers between 20 and 120 are:\n   \\[\n   21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, \\ldots, 117, 119\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Identify Multiples of 5:**\n   \n   Among these numbers, the multiples of 5 are:\n   \\[\n   25, 35, 45, 55, 65, 75, 85, 95, 105, 115\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Determine the Units Digit:**\n   \n   - **Multiplying by 5:** Any number ending in 5, when multiplied by another number, results in a product that ends in 5.\n   - **Multiple Multiples of 5:** Since there are multiple numbers ending in 5 in our list, the overall product will have a units digit of 5.\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n1.

He earned a 'B' on $32$ of the first $40$ tests. If he is to achieve his goal, on at most how many of the remaining tests can he earn a grade lower than a 'B'?\nA. 5\nB. 6\nC. 7\nD. 8\nE. 9\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. So John has this goal to earn a 'B' on at least 75% of his 60 tests for the semester. Hmm, 75% of 60 tests... let me calculate that first. \n\n75% is the same as 0.75, so 0.75 times 60. Let me do that multiplication. 0.75 times 60 is 45. So John needs to get at least 45 'B's out of his 60 tests to meet his goal. Got that.\n\nNow, he's already taken 40 tests and got 32 'B's. Hmm, so he's done 40 out of 60 tests, and he has 20 tests left. He has 32 'B's so far. So how many more 'B's does he need to get in the remaining 20 tests?\n\nHe needs a total of 45 'B's, and he already has 32. So subtracting, 45 minus 32 is 13. So he needs 13 more 'B's in his remaining 20 tests.\n\nWait, so if he needs 13 'B's out of 20, how many tests can he afford to get lower than a 'B'? That would be the remaining tests after the 13 'B's. So 20 minus 13 is 7. So he can get lower than a 'B' on 7 tests.\n\nLet me double-check that. He needs 45 'B's total. He has 32, needs 13 more. He has 20 tests left. If he gets 13 'B's, that brings him to 45. So the remaining 7 tests, he can get something lower than a 'B'. That makes sense.\n\nSo the answer should be 7. Looking at the options, that's option C.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\\boxed{C}\n<\/think>\n\nJohn's goal is to earn a 'B' on at least 75% of his 60 tests.

Therefore, he needs:\n\n\\[\n45 - 32 = 13\n\\]\n\nmore 'B's in the remaining 20 tests. This means he can afford to earn a grade lower than a 'B' on:\n\n\\[\n20 - 13 = 7\n\\]\n\nof the remaining tests.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\(\\boxed{C}\\).\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n1. **Determine the total number of tests John needs to score a B on to meet his goal:**\n   John's goal is to earn a B on at least 75% of his 60 tests. Therefore, the number of tests he needs to score a B on is:\n   \\[\n   0.75 \\times 60 = 45\n   \\]\n   tests.\n\n2. **Calculate the number of tests he has already scored a B on and the number he still needs to score a B on:**\n   John has already earned a B on 32 of the first 40 tests. Thus, the number of additional B's he needs to achieve his goal is:\n   \\[\n   45 - 32 = 13\n   \\]\n   tests.\n\n3. **Determine the number of tests remaining and how many of these he can afford to score less than a B on:**\n   There are a total of 60 tests, and he has completed 40. Therefore, the number of tests remaining is:\n   \\[\n   60 - 40 = 20\n   \\]\n   tests. To meet his goal, he needs to score a B on 13 out of these 20 remaining tests. Consequently, the maximum number of tests he can afford to score less than a B on is:\n   \\[\n   20 - 13 = 7\n   \\]\n   tests.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   John can afford to score less than a B on at most 7 of the remaining tests if he is to meet his goal of scoring a B on at least 75% of the tests.\n\nThe final answer is $7$.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{C}$.\n"}

Therefore, I can set up the equation:\n\\[\nA + (A + 4) + 25 = 83\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\n2A + 29 = 83\n\\]\n\nSubtracting 29 from both sides gives:\n\\[\n2A = 54\n\\]\n\nDividing both sides by 2, I find:\n\\[\nA = 27\n\\]\n\nSo, Allie's bowl contains 27 grapes.\n\nTo find out how many more grapes Allie's bowl has compared to Rob's bowl, I subtract the number of grapes in Rob's bowl from Allie's bowl:\n\\[\n27 - 25 = 2\n\\]\n\nTherefore, Allie's bowl has 2 more grapes than Rob's bowl.\n<\/think>\n\nLet's solve the problem step by step.\n\n**Given:**\n- **Rob's bowl:** 25 grapes\n- **Allyn's bowl:** 4 more grapes than Allie's bowl\n- **Total grapes in all three bowls:** 83\n\n**Let:**\n- \\( A \\) = Number of grapes in **Allie's bowl**\n- \\( A + 4 \\) = Number of grapes in **Allyn's bowl**\n\n**Step 1:** Write the equation for the total number of grapes.\n\n\\[\nA \\ (\\text{Allie}) + (A + 4) \\ (\\text{Allyn}) + 25 \\ (\\text{Rob}) = 83\n\\]\n\n**Step 2:** Combine like terms.\n\n\\[\nA + A + 4 + 25 = 83\n\\]\n\\[\n2A + 29 = 83\n\\]\n\n**Step 3:** Solve for \\( A \\).\n\n\\[\n2A = 83 - 29\n\\]\n\\[\n2A = 54\n\\]\n\\[\nA = \\frac{54}{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nA = 27\n\\]\n\n**Step 4:** Determine how many more grapes Allie's bowl has compared to Rob's bowl.\n\n\\[\n\\text{Difference} = A - \\text{Rob's grapes} = 27 - 25 = 2\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the number of grapes in Allie's bowl as A. According to the information given, Allyn's bowl contained A + 4 grapes.\n\nWe know the total number of grapes in all three bowls is 83, and Rob's bowl contained 25 grapes. So we can write the following equation to represent the total:\n\nA (Allie's bowl) + (A + 4) (Allyn's bowl) + 25 (Rob's bowl) = 83\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\n2A + 4 + 25 = 83\n\nNow, let's solve for A:\n\n2A + 29 = 83\n2A = 83 - 29\n2A = 54\nA = 54 \/ 2\nA = 27\n\nSo, Allie's bowl contained 27 grapes. Now, to find out how many more grapes Allie's bowl had compared to Rob's bowl, we subtract the number of grapes in Rob's bowl from the number of grapes in Allie's bowl:\n\nAllie's bowl - Rob's bowl = 27 - 25 = 2\n\nAllie's bowl had $\\boxed{2}$  more grapes compared to Rob's bowl.\n"}

She bought a sweater for $24, a T-shirt for $6, and a pair of shoes for $11. How much money does Carrie have left?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so Carrie's mom gave her $91 to go shopping. That's the starting point. Now, Carrie bought a few things: a sweater, a T-shirt, and a pair of shoes. I need to figure out how much money she has left after these purchases.\n\nFirst, let's list out what she bought and how much each item cost. The sweater was $24, the T-shirt was $6, and the shoes were $11. To find out the total amount she spent, I need to add up these amounts.\n\nSo, $24 for the sweater plus $6 for the T-shirt. Let me do that math: 24 plus 6 is 30. Okay, so after buying the sweater and the T-shirt, she's spent $30.\n\nNow, she also bought a pair of shoes for $11. So, I need to add that to the previous total. $30 plus $11 equals $41. So, in total, Carrie spent $41 on her shopping.\n\nNow, to find out how much money she has left, I need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her mom gave her. Her mom gave her $91, and she spent $41. So, $91 minus $41 equals $50.\n\nWait, let me double-check that to make sure I didn't make a mistake. 91 minus 41 is indeed 50. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, Carrie has $50 left after her shopping spree.\n<\/think>\n\nCarrie has $50 left after her shopping.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nCarrie spent $24 on the sweater, $6 on the T-shirt, and $11 on the shoes. To find out how much she spent in total, we add those amounts together:\n\n$24 (sweater) + $6 (T-shirt) + $11 (shoes) = $41\n\nNow, to find out how much money Carrie has left, we subtract the total amount she spent from the amount her mom gave her:\n\n$91 (initial amount) - $41 (total spent) = $50\n\nCarrie has $\\boxed{\\$50}$  left.\n"}

Time to the beauty parlor: 60 minutes\n2. Time back from the beauty parlor: Since her speed is half, it will take twice as long, so 2 * 60 = 120 minutes\n3. Traffic delay: 15 minutes\n4. Coffee break: 10 minutes\n\nTotal time for the first round trip = Time to the parlor + Time back + Traffic delay + Coffee break\n= 60 + 120 + 15 + 10\n= 205 minutes\n\n**Second Round Trip:**\n\n1. Time to the beauty parlor: 60 minutes (same as the first trip)\n2. Time back from the beauty parlor: Again, twice as long due to half the speed, so 120 minutes\n3. Road construction delay: 20 minutes\n4. Detour time: 30 minutes\n\nTotal time for the second round trip = Time to the parlor + Time back + Road construction delay + Detour time\n= 60 + 120 + 20 + 30\n= 230 minutes\n\nNow, we add the total times for both round trips to get the overall total time:\n\nTotal time for both round trips = First round trip time + Second round trip time\n= 205 + 230\n= 435 minutes\n\nTherefore, it will take Naomi a total of $\\boxed{435}$  minutes to complete the two round trips to the beauty parlor, considering all the additional conditions.\n"}

It's not just the negation; it's saying the opposite extreme. \n\nOption B says that some honor students do not receive scholarships, which aligns with what I was thinking earlier\u2014that there exists at least one honor student who doesn't get a scholarship. \n\nOption C is similar to A in that it's saying no honor students receive scholarships, which again is an extreme statement and not just the straightforward negation. \n\nOption D is actually the same as the original statement, so it's definitely not the negation.\n\nSo, based on this reasoning, the correct negation should be Option B: \"Some honor students do not receive scholarships.\"\n<\/think>\n\nThe negation of the statement \"All honor students receive scholarships\" is:\n\n**B) Some honor students do not receive scholarships**\n\nThis is because the original statement is a universal claim, and its negation involves the existence of at least one counterexample.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo find the negation of the statement \"All honor students receive scholarships,\" we need to analyze the logical structure of the statement:\n1. **Understanding the Original Statement**:\n   - The statement can be phrased in logical terms as:\n     \\[\n     \\forall x (\\text{if } x \\text{ is an honor student, then } x \\text{ receives a scholarship})\n     \\]\n   - This implies every honor student is a recipient of a scholarship.\n   \n2. **Negating the Statement**:\n   - Negating the above statement involves negating the universal quantifier and the implication. The negation of $\\forall x (P \\rightarrow Q)$ is $\\exists x (P \\wedge \\neg Q)$.\n   - The negation thus becomes:\n     \\[\n     \\exists x (\\text{x is an honor student and } x \\text{ does not receive a scholarship})\n     \\]\n   - This means there exists at least one honor student who does not receive a scholarship.\n\n3. **Formulating the Answer**:\n   - The correct negation translates to \"Some honor students do not receive scholarships.\"\n\nConclusion:\nThe negation of the statement \"All honor students receive scholarships\" is $\\text{Some honor students do not receive scholarships}$.\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{B}}$\n"}

How many did she have initially if she still has 92 games left?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so I have this problem here: Kelly gives away 91 Nintendo games. How many did she have initially if she still has 92 games left? Hmm, let's see. I need to find out how many games Kelly had before she gave any away. \n\nAlright, so she gave away 91 games and still has 92 left. That means the total number of games she had at the beginning is the sum of the games she gave away and the games she still has. So, I think I need to add the number of games she gave away to the number of games she has left to find the initial amount.\n\nLet me write that down: Initial games = Games given away + Games left. Plugging in the numbers, that would be Initial games = 91 + 92. Okay, so 91 plus 92. Let me do the math. 91 plus 90 is 181, and then plus 2 more is 183. So, 91 plus 92 equals 183.\n\nWait, does that make sense? If she had 183 games and gave away 91, she should have 92 left. Let me check: 183 minus 91 is 92. Yeah, that works out. So, it looks like the initial number of games Kelly had was 183.\n\nI think that's it. It seems straightforward\u2014just adding the games given away to the games remaining to find the original amount. I don't see any complications here, like maybe some games being lost or something, but the problem doesn't mention anything like that. So, I guess it's a simple addition problem.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine how many Nintendo games Kelly initially had, we can use the information provided:\n\n- **Games given away:** 91\n- **Games remaining:** 92\n\nThe initial number of games Kelly had is the sum of the games she gave away and the games she still has. \n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial games} = \\text{Games given away} + \\text{Games left}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the given values:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Initial games} = 91 + 92 = 183\n\\]\n\n**Answer:** Kelly initially had \\(\\boxed{183}\\) Nintendo games.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nIf Kelly still has 92 games left after giving away 91 games, then the total number of games she had initially is the sum of the games she gave away and the games she still has.\n\nInitial games = Games given away + Games left\nInitial games = 91 + 92\nInitial games = 183\n\nKelly initially had $\\boxed{183}$  Nintendo games.\n"}

I need to find out how many servings are in that container. The problem says there are 6 servings of honey per ounce. So, if there are 6 servings in each ounce, then in 16 ounces, there should be 6 times 16 servings.\n\nLet me calculate that: 6 servings\/ounce multiplied by 16 ounces equals 96 servings in total.\n\nNow, since Tabitha uses 2 servings each night, I can find out how many nights the honey will last by dividing the total number of servings by the number of servings she uses each night. So, 96 servings divided by 2 servings per night equals 48 nights.\n\nWait, does that make sense? Let me double-check my calculations. 6 servings per ounce times 16 ounces is indeed 96 servings. And 2 servings per night times 48 nights is 96 servings. Yeah, that seems right.\n\nSo, based on this, Tabitha will be able to enjoy honey in her tea for 48 nights before she runs out of honey.\n<\/think>\n\nTabitha will be able to enjoy honey in her tea for **48 nights** before she runs out of honey.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo solve this problem, we follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the total servings of honey needed per night. Tabitha uses 1 serving of honey per cup of tea and drinks 2 cups of tea each night. Therefore, the total servings needed per night are:\n   \\[\n   1 \\text{ serving\/cup} \\times 2 \\text{ cups} = 2 \\text{ servings\/night}\n   \\]\n\n2. Determine the total servings of honey available in the 16-ounce container. Since there are 6 servings of honey per ounce, the total servings in a 16-ounce container are:\n   \\[\n   6 \\text{ servings\/ounce} \\times 16 \\text{ ounces} = 96 \\text{ servings}\n   \\]\n\n3. Calculate the number of nights the 16-ounce container of honey will last. Given that Tabitha uses 2 servings of honey per night, the number of nights the honey will last is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{96 \\text{ servings}}{2 \\text{ servings\/night}} = 48 \\text{ nights}\n   \\]\n\nTherefore, the 16-ounce container of honey will last Tabitha for $\\boxed{48}$ nights.\n"}

She also bought 3 blouses for $6 each. She paid the cashier $100. How much change did she receive?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so Jane bought some skirts and blouses, and I need to figure out how much change she got after paying $100. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, she bought 2 skirts, each costing $13. So, to find out how much she spent on skirts, I should multiply the number of skirts by the price per skirt. That would be 2 times $13. Let me calculate that: 2 * 13 equals $26. Okay, so she spent $26 on skirts.\n\nNext, she bought 3 blouses, and each blouse costs $6. To find the total cost for the blouses, I need to multiply the number of blouses by the price per blouse. That's 3 times $6. Calculating that: 3 * 6 equals $18. So, she spent $18 on blouses.\n\nNow, to find the total amount she spent altogether, I should add the cost of the skirts and the cost of the blouses. That would be $26 plus $18. Let me add those: 26 + 18 equals $44. So, the total amount she spent is $44.\n\nJane paid the cashier $100. To find out how much change she received, I need to subtract the total amount she spent from the amount she paid. That would be $100 minus $44. Calculating that: 100 - 44 equals $56. So, Jane received $56 in change.\n\nWait, let me double-check my calculations to make sure I didn't make any mistakes. For the skirts: 2 * 13 is indeed 26. For the blouses: 3 * 6 is 18. Adding those together: 26 + 18 is 44. Subtracting that from 100: 100 - 44 is 56. Yep, that seems correct.\n\nI think I've got it right. Jane received $56 in change after her purchases.\n<\/think>\n\nJane received $56 in change after her purchases.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo solve the problem step by step, we start by calculating the cost of the skirts and blouses separately, then add them together to find the total cost. Finally, we subtract the total cost from the amount Jane paid to find her change.\n\n1. Calculate the cost of the skirts:\n   - Each skirt costs $13, and Jane bought 2 skirts.\n   - The total cost for the skirts is $13 \\times 2 = \\$26.\n\n2. Calculate the cost of the blouses:\n   - Each blouse costs $6, and Jane bought 3 blouses.\n   - The total cost for the blouses is $6 \\times 3 = \\$18.\n\n3.

This is because \\(225^\\circ\\) is \\(180^\\circ + 45^\\circ\\), placing it beyond the 180-degree mark but before the 270-degree mark.\n\nIn the third quadrant, both the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) coordinates of a point on the unit circle are negative. The reference angle for \\(225^\\circ\\) is the acute angle it makes with the \\(x\\)-axis, which is \\(45^\\circ\\).\n\nI recall that for a \\(45^\\circ\\) angle, the coordinates on the unit circle are \\(\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\). Since \\(225^\\circ\\) is in the third quadrant, both coordinates are negative. Therefore, the coordinates for \\(225^\\circ\\) are \\(\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\).\n\nThe cosine of an angle corresponds to the \\(x\\)-coordinate of the point on the unit circle.

A point in the third quadrant has both negative $x$ and $y$ coordinates. Since the reference angle here (the acute angle with the $x$-axis) is $45^\\circ$, we know from symmetry and the properties of $45^\\circ-45^\\circ-90^\\circ$ triangles that the coordinates of $Q$ must be negative versions of those at $45^\\circ$, which are $\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$.\n\nThus, the coordinates of $Q$ are $\\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}, -\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)$.

On a six-sided die, the numbers greater than four are 5 and 6, which gives us 2 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability is 2\/6, which simplifies to 1\/3.\n\nNext, I need to find the probability of rolling a number greater than two on the second die. The numbers greater than two on a six-sided die are 3, 4, 5, and 6, resulting in 4 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. This probability is 4\/6, which simplifies to 2\/3.\n\nSince the two dice rolls are independent events, the probability of both events occurring simultaneously is the product of their individual probabilities.

What is the weekly charge for the motel?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nFirst, I need to determine the weekly charge for the motel. Casey is staying for 3 months, and each month has exactly 4 weeks, so she will stay for a total of 12 weeks.\n\nIf she pays monthly, the total cost for 3 months is 3 multiplied by $1000, which equals $3000.\n\nCasey saves $360 by paying monthly instead of weekly. This means the total cost if she pays weekly is $360 more than the monthly cost. Therefore, the total weekly cost is $3000 plus $360, which equals $3360.\n\nTo find the weekly charge, I divide the total weekly cost by the number of weeks.

So, she would be staying for a total of 3 months * 4 weeks\/month = 12 weeks.\n\nIf she were to pay weekly, her total cost would be 12 weeks * W dollars\/week.\n\nHowever, she is given the option to pay monthly at a rate of $1000\/month. Since she is staying for 3 months, her total cost for paying monthly would be 3 months * $1000\/month = $3000.\n\nWe are told that by paying monthly, Casey saves $360. This means that the total cost of paying weekly is $360 more than the total cost of paying monthly.\n\nSo, we can set up the following equation:\n\n12W (total cost if paying weekly) = $3000 (total cost if paying monthly) + $360 (savings by paying monthly)\n\nNow we can solve for W:\n\n12W = $3000 + $360\n12W = $3360\n\nDivide both sides by 12 to find the weekly charge:\n\nW = $3360 \/ 12\nW = $280\n\nTherefore, the weekly charge for the motel is $\\boxed{\\$280}$ .\n"}

Therefore, we can set up the equation:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times (S - 3) = 28\n\\]\n\n**Step 2: Solve for \\( S \\)**\n\n\\[\n4S - 12 = 28\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4S = 28 + 12\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4S = 40\n\\]\n\n\\[\nS = \\frac{40}{4} = 10\n\\]\n\nSo, Lucas has a total of **10 students**.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate Last Monday's Chocolate Candy**\n\nLast Monday, all 10 students were present. Since Lucas makes 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each student, the total number of pieces he made is:\n\n\\[\n4 \\times 10 = 40\n\\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{40}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the number of students Lucas has as S. Since 3 students will not be coming this upcoming Monday, he will be making chocolate candy for S - 3 students. We know that he will make 28 pieces of chocolate candy for S - 3 students, and he makes 4 pieces per student. So we can write the equation:\n\n4 * (S - 3) = 28\n\nNow we can solve for S:\n\n4S - 12 = 28\n4S = 28 + 12\n4S = 40\nS = 40 \/ 4\nS = 10\n\nSo Lucas has 10 students in total. Last Monday, when all of his students were present, he made 4 pieces of chocolate candy for each of them. Therefore, the total number of pieces he made last Monday is:\n\n4 pieces\/student * 10 students = 40 pieces\n\nLucas made $\\boxed{40}$  pieces of chocolate candy for his class last Monday.\n"}

If there are 8 rabbits in Minyoung's house, how many chickens, ducks, and rabbits are there in total in Minyoung's house?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nFirst, I need to determine the number of ducks. The problem states there are 17 fewer rabbits than ducks, and there are 8 rabbits. So, I can set up the equation D - 17 = 8, where D represents the number of ducks.\n\nSolving for D:\nD - 17 = 8\nD = 8 + 17\nD = 25\n\nNext, I'll find the number of chickens. The problem mentions there are four times as many chickens as ducks. Since there are 25 ducks, the number of chickens is 4 times 25, which equals 100.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the total number of animals by adding the number of chickens, ducks, and rabbits:\n100 (chickens) + 25 (ducks) + 8 (rabbits) = 133\n\nTherefore, there are 133 animals in total in Minyoung's house.\n<\/think>\n\nLet's determine the total number of chickens, ducks, and rabbits in Minyoung's house step by step.\n\n### **Given:**\n1. **Number of rabbits (R):** 8\n2. **Relationship between ducks (D) and rabbits:** There are 17 fewer rabbits than ducks.\n   \\[\n   D - 17 = R\n   \\]\n3. **Relationship between chickens (C) and ducks:** There are four times as many chickens as ducks.\n   \\[\n   C = 4D\n   \\]\n\n### **Step 1: Find the Number of Ducks (D)**\nUsing the relationship between ducks and rabbits:\n\\[\nD - 17 = 8\n\\]\n\\[\nD = 8 + 17\n\\]\n\\[\nD = 25\n\\]\n\n### **Step 2: Find the Number of Chickens (C)**\nUsing the relationship between chickens and ducks:\n\\[\nC = 4D = 4 \\times 25 = 100\n\\]\n\n### **Step 3: Calculate the Total Number of Animals**\n\\[\n\\text{Total} = C + D + R = 100 + 25 + 8 = 133\n\\]\n\n### **Final Answer**\n\\[\n\\boxed{133}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the number of ducks as D.

What is the tip percentage for the meal?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nFirst, I need to determine the tip percentage based on the given information. The total amount allowed for the meal is $75, which includes the cost of the food, sales tax, and the tip.\n\nThe maximum cost for the food before tax and tip is $61.48. The sales tax rate is 7%, so I'll calculate the sales tax by multiplying the food cost by 7%.\n\nNext, I'll add the food cost and the sales tax to find the total amount spent on the meal before adding the tip.\n\nTo find the tip amount, I'll subtract the total spent on food and sales tax from the total allowed amount of $75.\n\nFinally, I'll calculate the tip percentage by dividing the tip amount by the food cost and then multiplying by 100 to convert it to a percentage.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine the tip percentage for the meal, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Understand the Total Allowance:**\n   - **Total Amount Allowed:** \\$75\n   - **Meal Cost (before tax and tip):** \\$61.48\n   - **Sales Tax Rate:** 7%\n\n2. **Calculate the Sales Tax:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Sales Tax} = \\text{Meal Cost} \\times \\text{Sales Tax Rate} = \\$61.48 \\times 0.07 = \\$4.3036\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Total Amount Spent on Food and Tax:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total Food and Tax} = \\text{Meal Cost} + \\text{Sales Tax} = \\$61.48 + \\$4.3036 = \\$65.7836\n   \\]\n\n4. **Calculate the Tip Amount:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tip Amount} = \\text{Total Allowance} - \\text{Total Food and Tax} = \\$75 - \\$65.7836 = \\$9.2164\n   \\]\n\n5. **Determine the Tip Percentage:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tip Percentage} = \\left( \\frac{\\text{Tip Amount}}{\\text{Meal Cost}} \\right) \\times 100 = \\left( \\frac{\\$9.2164}{\\$61.48} \\right) \\times 100 \\approx 14.99\\%\n   \\]\n\n6. **Round to the Nearest Whole Number:**\n   \\[\n   \\text{Tip Percentage} \\approx 15\\%\n   \\]\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{15\\%}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the tip percentage as T (in decimal form, so for example, 15% would be 0.15).\n\nThe total cost of the meal including the sales tax and the tip can be expressed as:\n\nTotal Cost = Meal Cost + Sales Tax + Tip\n\nWe know the Total Cost cannot exceed $75, and the Meal Cost is given as $61.48. The Sales Tax is 7% of the Meal Cost, which can be calculated as:\n\nSales Tax = 0.07 * Meal Cost\n\nNow, the Tip is T percent of the Meal Cost before tax, which can be calculated as:\n\nTip = T * Meal Cost\n\nPutting it all together, we have:\n\n$75 \u2265 Meal Cost + Sales Tax + Tip\n\nSubstituting the known values, we get:\n\n$75 \u2265 $61.48 + (0.07 * $61.48) + (T * $61.48)\n\nNow, let's calculate the sales tax:\n\nSales Tax = 0.07 * $61.48 = $4.3036\n\nNow we can substitute the Sales Tax back into the inequality:\n\n$75 \u2265 $61.48 + $4.3036 + (T * $61.48)\n\nCombining the known values:\n\n$75 \u2265 $65.7836 + (T * $61.48)\n\nNow, let's isolate T:\n\n$75 - $65.7836 \u2265 T * $61.48\n\n$9.2164 \u2265 T * $61.48\n\nNow, divide both sides by $61.48 to solve for T:\n\nT \u2264 $9.2164 \/ $61.48\n\nT \u2264 0.1499 (approximately)\n\nTo express T as a percentage, we multiply by 100:\n\nT \u2264 14.99%\n\nSince the question asks for the tip percentage, we can round this to the nearest whole number if necessary.

The first number was incorrectly recorded as 19 greater than the actual number. To correct this, I subtract 19 from the total sum.\n2. The second number was mistakenly entered as 13 instead of the correct value, 31. To fix this, I add the difference between 31 and 13, which is 18, to the total sum.\n\nBy applying these corrections, the adjusted total sum becomes:\n402 - 19 + 18 = 401.\n\nFinally, to find the correct average, I divide the adjusted total sum by the number of numbers, which is 10:\n401 \u00f7 10 = 40.1.\n\nTherefore, the correct average of the 10 numbers is 40.1.\n<\/think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nWe are given that the average of 10 numbers is 40.2.

The new iPhone costs $800. She can trade in her Samsung Galaxy for $240. She can make $80 per week babysitting. How many weeks does she have to work before she can purchase the iPhone?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, so Carrie wants to buy a new iPhone, and it costs $800. She has a Samsung Galaxy that she can trade in for $240. That's a good start because it reduces the amount she needs to come up with. Now, she makes $80 per week babysitting. The question is, how many weeks does she need to work to afford the iPhone after trading in her Samsung?\n\nFirst, I need to figure out how much money Carrie still needs after the trade-in. The iPhone costs $800, and she's getting $240 for her Galaxy. So, subtracting the trade-in value from the total cost should give me the remaining amount she needs. That would be $800 minus $240, which equals $560. Okay, so Carrie needs an additional $560 to buy the iPhone.\n\nNow, she earns $80 each week from babysitting. To find out how many weeks she needs to work to make $560, I can divide the total amount she needs by her weekly earnings. So, $560 divided by $80 per week. Let me do that calculation: 560 divided by 80 is 7. So, Carrie needs to work for 7 weeks to earn enough money to buy the iPhone after the trade-in.\n\nWait a minute, let me double-check that. If she works 7 weeks at $80 per week, that's 7 times 80, which is indeed $560. Adding the $240 from the trade-in, that gives her a total of $800, which is exactly the cost of the iPhone. So, yes, 7 weeks seems correct.\n\nI wonder if there's any other factor I need to consider, like taxes or additional fees. But the problem doesn't mention anything like that, so I think it's safe to assume that the $80 per week is her net earnings, and the trade-in value is straightforward. Therefore, 7 weeks is the right answer.\n<\/think>\n\nCarrie needs to work for 7 weeks to afford the iPhone after trading in her Samsung Galaxy. Here's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Cost of the iPhone:** $800\n2. **Trade-in value of Samsung Galaxy:** $240\n3. **Remaining amount needed:** $800 - $240 = $560\n4. **Weekly earnings from babysitting:** $80\n5. **Number of weeks required:** $560 \u00f7 $80 = 7 weeks\n\nTherefore, Carrie needs to work for **7 weeks** to save enough money to purchase the iPhone.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo solve this problem, we break it down into two main steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the remaining cost after trading in the Samsung Galaxy:**\n   - The cost of the new iPhone is $800.\n   - The trade-in value of the Samsung Galaxy is $240.\n   - Therefore, the remaining cost after the trade-in is $800 - $240 = $560.\n\n2. **Determine the number of weeks required to save enough money:**\n   - Carrie earns $80 per week from babysitting.\n   - The remaining cost of the iPhone is $560.\n   - Thus, the number of weeks required to save enough money is $560 \/ $80 = 7 weeks.\n\nTherefore, Carrie needs to work for $\\boxed{7}$ weeks before she can purchase the iPhone.\n"}

The difference in weight is 75 kg minus 45 kg, which equals 30 kg.\n\nSince the group consists of 10 people, this additional 30 kg will affect the average weight of the entire group. To find out how much the average weight increases, I divide the total weight increase by the number of people in the group.\n\nSo, the average weight increase is 30 kg divided by 10, which equals 3 kg.\n\nTherefore, the average weight of the group increased by 3 kg.\n<\/think>\n\nTo determine how much the average weight of the group increased when a person weighing \\(45\\,\\text{kg}\\) is replaced by a person weighing \\(75\\,\\text{kg}\\), follow these steps:\n\n1. **Calculate the Change in Total Weight:**\n\n   The difference in weight between the new person and the person being replaced is:\n   \\[\n   75\\,\\text{kg} - 45\\,\\text{kg} = 30\\,\\text{kg}\n   \\]\n   \n2. **Determine the Increase in Average Weight:**\n\n   Since the group consists of \\(10\\) people, the additional \\(30\\,\\text{kg}\\) is distributed equally among all members. Therefore, the increase in average weight is:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{30\\,\\text{kg}}{10} = 3\\,\\text{kg}\n   \\]\n   \n3. **Final Answer:**\n\n   The average weight of the group increased by:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{3\\,\\text{kg}}\n   \\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the total weight of the original 9 people (excluding the 45 kg person) as W. The total weight of the group before the replacement is W + 45 kg.\n\nThe average weight of the group before the replacement is:\n(W + 45 kg) \/ 10\n\nAfter the replacement, the new total weight of the group is W + 75 kg (since the 45 kg person was replaced by a 75 kg person).\n\nThe average weight of the group after the replacement is:\n(W + 75 kg) \/ 10\n\nTo find the increase in the average weight, we subtract the original average from the new average:\n[(W + 75 kg) \/ 10] - [(W + 45 kg) \/ 10]\n\nSimplifying the expression, we get:\n(W + 75 kg - W - 45 kg) \/ 10\n(75 kg - 45 kg) \/ 10\n30 kg \/ 10\n3 kg\n\nSo, the average weight of the group increased by $\\boxed{3}$  kg.\n"}

Therefore, the relevant divisors are:\n   \\[\n   1, \\ 2, \\ 3, \\ 4, \\ 6\n   \\]\n\n3. **Count the Favorable Outcomes:**\n   \n   There are **5** favorable outcomes (numbers that are both divisors of 12 and appear on the die).\n\n4. **Calculate the Probability:**\n   \n   The probability \\( P \\) of rolling a divisor of 12 is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of possible outcomes. Since the die has 8 sides, the total number of possible outcomes is 8.\n   \\[\n   P = \\frac{\\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Number of Possible Outcomes}} = \\frac{5}{8}\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   \\[\n   \\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}\n   \\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\n- First, identify the divisors of 12. The divisors are $1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12$.\n- Count the valid outcomes which are divisors of 12 and appear on the die: $1, 2, 3, 4, 6$.\n- Calculate the probability: Since there are 5 favorable outcomes (divisors of 12 that are \u2264 8) and the die has 8 sides, the probability is $\\dfrac{5}{8}$.\n\nConclusion: The probability that the number rolled is a divisor of 12 is $\\boxed{\\dfrac{5}{8}}$.\n"}

The length of the box is 3 times its height and 4 times its width. The diagonal length of the box is 60 inches. What is the volume of the box?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nFirst, I need to identify the given dimensions of the box. The height (H) is 12 inches. The length (L) is 3 times the height, so L = 3 * 12 = 36 inches. The width (W) is 1\/4 of the length, so W = 36 \/ 4 = 9 inches.\n\nNext, I'll calculate the volume of the box using the formula for the volume of a rectangular box: Volume = H * L * W. Plugging in the values, Volume = 12 * 36 * 9.\n\nMultiplying 12 by 36 gives 432. Then, multiplying 432 by 9 results in 3888 cubic inches.\n\nTherefore, the volume of the box is 3888 cubic inches.\n<\/think>\n\n**Solution:**\n\nLet's determine the volume of Justin's box step by step.\n\n1. **Given Dimensions:**\n   - **Height (H):** 12 inches\n   - **Length (L):** 3 times the height\n   - **Width (W):** 1\/4 of the length\n   - **Diagonal (d):** 60 inches\n\n2. **Calculate Length (L):**\n   \\[\n   L = 3 \\times H = 3 \\times 12 = 36 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Calculate Width (W):**\n   \\[\n   W = \\frac{L}{4} = \\frac{36}{4} = 9 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n\n4. **Verify the Diagonal:**\n   The diagonal of a rectangular box can be found using the formula:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{H^2 + L^2 + W^2}\n   \\]\n   Plugging in the values:\n   \\[\n   d = \\sqrt{12^2 + 36^2 + 9^2} = \\sqrt{144 + 1296 + 81} = \\sqrt{1521} = 39 \\text{ inches}\n   \\]\n   However, this result contradicts the given diagonal of 60 inches.

We are given that:\n\nH = 12 inches\nL = 3H\nW = L \/ 4\n\nFrom the information given, we can express L and W in terms of H:\n\nL = 3 * 12 = 36 inches\nW = 36 \/ 4 = 9 inches\n\nWe are also given that the diagonal of the box is 60 inches. The diagonal d of a rectangular box can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions:\n\nd\u00b2 = H\u00b2 + L\u00b2 + W\u00b2\n\nPlugging in the values we have:\n\n60\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 36\u00b2 + 9\u00b2\n3600 = 144 + 1296 + 81\n3600 = 1521\n\nThis does not add up correctly, which means there might be a mistake in the given information or in our calculations. Let's recheck our calculations:\n\n60\u00b2 = 12\u00b2 + 36\u00b2 + 9\u00b2\n3600 = 144 + 1296 + 81\n3600 = 144 + 1296 + 81\n3600 = 1521\n\nThe sum of 144, 1296, and 81 is indeed 1521, so there is a discrepancy in the given information. The diagonal length of 60 inches does not match the dimensions provided for the box.\n\nHowever, if we assume that the given dimensions and the diagonal are correct, we can still calculate the volume of the box using the dimensions of height, length, and width:\n\nVolume = H * L * W\nVolume = 12 * 36 * 9\n\nNow, let's calculate the volume:\n\nVolume = 12 * 36 * 9\nVolume = 432 * 9\nVolume = 3888 cubic inches\n\nSo, if we disregard the discrepancy with the diagonal length, the volume of the box would be $\\boxed{3888}$  cubic inches.\n"}

To find the total number of votes cast in the election, I can set up the equation 0.70 * V = 490, where V represents the total votes. Solving for V, I divide both sides by 0.70, resulting in V = 700.\n\nNext, I determine the number of votes the losing candidate received by calculating 30% of the total votes, since the winner took 70%. This is done by multiplying 0.30 by 700, which equals 210 votes.\n\nFinally, to find the margin by which the winner won, I subtract the losing candidate's votes from the winning candidate's votes: 490 - 210 = 280.

Let \\( V \\) represent the total number of votes cast in the election.\n\n   \\[\n   0.70 \\times V = 490\n   \\]\n\n   Solving for \\( V \\):\n\n   \\[\n   V = \\frac{490}{0.70} = 700\n   \\]\n\n   So, the total number of votes cast was **700**.\n\n2. **Calculate the Number of Votes Received by the Losing Candidate:**\n\n   Since the winning candidate received 70% of the votes, the losing candidate received the remaining 30%.\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Losing Candidate's Votes} = 0.30 \\times V = 0.30 \\times 700 = 210\n   \\]\n\n3. **Determine the Winning Margin:**\n\n   The difference between the votes received by the winning candidate and the losing candidate is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Winning Margin} = 490 - 210 = 280\n   \\]\n\n   Therefore, the winning candidate won the election by **280 votes**.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{280}\n\\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nIf the winning candidate received 70% of the votes and a total of 490 votes, we can calculate the total number of votes cast in the election.\n\nLet's denote the total number of votes as V.

Let's determine the distance the van needs to cover.\n\n1. **Calculate the new time:**\n   \n   The new time is \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\) of the original time.\n   \\[\n   \\text{New Time} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times 5\\ \\text{hours} = 7.5\\ \\text{hours}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Determine the distance using the new speed and time:**\n   \n   The formula to calculate distance is:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = \\text{Speed} \\times \\text{Time}\n   \\]\n   \n   Plugging in the given values:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Distance} = 58\\ \\text{kph} \\times 7.5\\ \\text{hours} = 435\\ \\text{kilometers}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Final Answer:**\n   \n   The distance the van needs to cover is:\n   \\[\n   \\boxed{435\\ \\text{kilometers}}\n   \\]\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nLet's denote the distance the van needs to cover as \\( D \\) and the original speed as \\( S \\).\n\nGiven that the van takes 5 hours to cover the distance \\( D \\), we can write the equation:\n\\[ D = S \\times 5 \\]  (1)\n\nThe problem states that the van should maintain a speed of 58 kph to cover the same distance in \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\) of the previous time. This means the new time taken is \\( \\frac{3}{2} \\times 5 \\) hours, which simplifies to \\( 7.5 \\) hours.\n\nUsing the new speed of 58 kph, we can write the equation:\n\\[ D = 58 \\times 7.5 \\]  (2)\n\nNow we can solve equation (2) for \\( D \\):\n\\[ D = 58 \\times 7.5 \\]\n\\[ D = 435 \\]\n\nSo, the distance the van needs to cover is $\\boxed{435}$  kilometers.\n"}
{"text":"\nyou are a mathematics expert,skilled in solving methematical problems and logical reasoning.\nPlease read the question carefully and provide detailed solution steps.\n\n<|Question|>\nPaul made forty-four dollars mowing lawns and some money weed eating. If he only spent nine dollars a week, the money would last him 8 weeks. How much money did he make weed eating?\n\n<|Solution process|>\n<think>\nOkay, let's see. So, Paul made some money mowing lawns and some money weed eating. He made $44 from mowing lawns, and we don't know how much he made from weed eating. But we do know that if he spends $9 a week, his money will last him 8 weeks. So, I need to figure out how much he made from weed eating.\n\nFirst, maybe I should figure out how much money Paul has in total. If he spends $9 each week and this lasts him 8 weeks, then the total amount of money he has must be enough to cover 8 weeks of spending. So, I can calculate that by multiplying $9 by 8. Let me do that: 9 times 8 is 72. So, Paul has $72 in total.\n\nNow, out of this $72, we know that $44 came from mowing lawns. So, the rest must have come from weed eating. To find out how much he made from weed eating, I can subtract the $44 he made from mowing lawns from the total $72. So, 72 minus 44 equals... let me calculate that. 72 minus 40 is 32, and then minus 4 more is 28. So, Paul made $28 from weed eating.\n\nWait, let me double-check that. If he made $44 from mowing and $28 from weed eating, that adds up to $72. And if he spends $9 a week, then 72 divided by 9 is 8 weeks. Yeah, that makes sense. So, I think $28 is the right answer.\n<\/think>\n\nPaul made $28 from weed eating.\n\n<|Final Answer|>\nTo find out how much money Paul made weed eating, we first need to determine how much money he had in total to last him 8 weeks.\n\nIf Paul spent $9 a week and the money lasted him 8 weeks, then we can calculate the total amount of money he had by multiplying the weekly spending by the number of weeks:\n\nTotal money = Weekly spending \u00d7 Number of weeks\nTotal money = $9\/week \u00d7 8 weeks\nTotal money = $72\n\nNow we know that Paul had $72 in total. We also know that he made $44 from mowing lawns. To find out how much he made from weed eating, we subtract the money he made from mowing lawns from the total amount of money he had:\n\nMoney made weed eating = Total money - Money made mowing lawns\nMoney made weed eating = $72 - $44\nMoney made weed eating = $28\n\nTherefore, Paul made $\\boxed{\\$28}$  from weed eating.\n"}
