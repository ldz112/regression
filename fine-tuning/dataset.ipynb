However, the labels specifying males and females are unreaded. If it is known that one rectangle represents all males in the village, how many males are there?\n",

      "To determine the number of males in the village, let's analyze the given information step by step.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Total Population**: The village has a total population of **520**.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Division into Groups**: The population is divided into **four equal groups**, each represented by a rectangle on the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Equal Group Size**: Since the groups are equal, each group represents:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   \\frac{520}{4} = 130\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Males Representation**: It is specified that **one rectangle represents all males** in the village.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Number of Males**: Therefore, the number of males is equal to the size of one group:\n",

      "\n",
      "**Final Answer**: \\(\\boxed{130}\\)\n",
      "\n",
      "<|Final Answer|>\n",
      "1. **Understanding the Situation**: The total population is given as $520$, divided into four rectangles of equal population size. Each rectangle represents a different group (males, females, adults, children), but only the male group is needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Formulating the Equation**: Each rectangle holds an equal quarter of the total population:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   4x = 520\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Solving for $x$**: Solving for $x$ gives:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   x = \\frac{520}{4} = 130\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Determining Males**: Knowing one rectangle represents males, the number of males is exactly one rectangle's population:\n",
      "   \\[\n",
      "   130\n",
      "   \\]\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Conclusion**: Thus, the village has $130$ males.\n",
      "The correct answer is $\\boxed{\\text{(B)}\\ 130}$.\n",
